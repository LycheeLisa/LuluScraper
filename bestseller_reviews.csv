0,I was so incredibly excited to get this jacket but ultimately returned it. The jacket had two problematic issues. The sleeves were awkward (one was longer than the other) and the bottom was very snug. I’m 5’6” athletic built and the jacket was very tight and was toot tight around my waist. I wouldn’t have been able to sit in it. I have been buying lulu lemon for years and this is the first time I have had an issue with my items.,2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
1,"I love everything about this jacket, but it takes so much effort to zip it up, every time! It's the same story. Grab jacket, put on, try to do up zipper, gets stuck, try again, gets stuck, have to sit down and zip it up carefully, success on third or fourth try. For this price, zipper should be bomber.",1,RUNNER,45-54,Rain Rebel Jacket
2,"Love this jacket! Gorgeous orange color, light and comfortable. I've used it to-and-fro on misty days (not as functional heavy rain gear) and its been great for my use. Would recommend.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
3,"I was looking for an in between season jacket for rainy days and this one is perfect. Love that I can wear it over a puffy down jacket as well.
I wanted a classy/sporty jacket and even according to my boyfriend, this black one does it all. I haven’t had any problems with the zipper so far (like I read in other commentary). I hope I won’t in the future!
If you want to wear it as a second coat, size up. I’m in between sizes and I don’t regret sizing up.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
4,"5'3, 110lb and the size 4 fit perfectly, with a little room for a sweater or hoodie underneath. Purchased this jacket for rainy dog walks and commutes in Vancouver, when my hands are too full to carry an umbrella. I wanted a jacket that was truly waterproof, and the Rain Rebel delivered.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
5,"I ordered my usual size 4, however I have an athletic build but a little booty/hips and when I zipped the jacket and I went to sit down it pulled pretty tight to my lower half that I’d end up unzipping it. I ordered the 6 and I think it will fit better...even though the top fit like a glove.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
6,"Love this jacket. I usually wear a size 6 and the size 6 fits perfect. I also tried the size 4, which was more form fitting, but I wanted more space to wear layers. I only got to wea the jacket briefly in the rain and it did a great job of keeping me dry. I like the deep pockets and the clinching and the deep hood. I can see that the zipper could get stuck if you aren't careful when zipping. Can't wait to test it out on my trip to Seattle in October!",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
7,Super cute and stylish - great fit and perfect for rainy days.,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,Rain Rebel Jacket
8,"I am 5ft3 105lbs, I bought this in size 4 and the fit is perfect. It looks stylish and the fabric is very nice. This can definitely be worn all year round. The only problem that I have with this jacket is that the zipper broke before I even get to try it on! I was going to return but I needed a jacket for my trip. I would’ve given this a 5 if the zipper did not break right away.",3,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
9,"I love this coat the color is awesome especially on a dreary rainy day, the fabric and fit are great. I love my new coat and would recommend to anyone wanting a punch of color in their
wardrobe.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,OVER 65,Rain Rebel Jacket
10,"I love the fit and design of this coat. Unfortunately, I wore it on a rainy day over a light coloured dress and the purple dye stained my dress.",3,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
11,"I had to return the item due to dark stains in the fabric. Otherwise it would have been great, unfortunately it sold out by the time I went to reorder. The design would be much better with the metal or reflective silver lulu sign on the tail vs the same color sign you could not even see the logo and for such and expensive raincoat I at least want to see the logo.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
12,"I saw this jacket in the store and loved it on the hanger. They didn’t have my size in store so I ordered online. The quality and look of it are great, but it did not work on my body at all. The top was baggy, yet the bottom was too tight around my hips. This jacket is not made for curvy girls. A size up would have been way too big on top.",3,RUNNER,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
13,"Great fit, comfortable feel and lovely color.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,OVER 65,Rain Rebel Jacket
14,"Absolutely love everything about his jacket because of the simple and clean cut and features. It's a classic and necessity in every wardrobe. The fabric is sleek and elegant, and the design is versatile. It could be dressed up or down and be worn in different circumstances. I am 47 years old, 5'4"" height, 115lbs, and purchased size 4. It fits great. So far no issues with the zipper like other reviewers had mentioned. Hopefully this was part of a new batch and those issues will not arise. Fingers crossed.",5,YOGI,45-54,Rain Rebel Jacket
15,Unfortunately I am only Five foot and it’s below my knees. I had to return. This is made for a tall person.,5,YOGI,55-65,Rain Rebel Jacket
16,I love this rain jacket. It is so lightweight! Can easily stuff into my purse as it takes up no room at all. Keeps me dry with lots of pockets inside and out. Great fit too! Recommend if you’re looking for a light layer to run in misty mornings.,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
17,"I love the style and colors of this jacket and would LOVE to snag one of the brighter colors. I have been desperately waiting for a re stock in size 14.. which seems like all other sizes get replenished except 14.. PLEASE Lululemon, restock in the bigger sizes!",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
18,This jacket provided the right amount of warmth and protection from rain while traveling. It was easy to pack and did not wrinkle when stuffed into a bag.,5,CYCLIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
19,"I love the style and color, but the zipper doesn't work! I now see that there has been several complaints about the zipper so it's clearly a well-known problem -- why sell a known faulty product as a final, non-returnable sale?? I love Lululemon, but it's really a bummer that they make all sale products not returnable, whereas other similar athletic brands such as Athleta allows even worn and washed products to be returned at any time if not completely satisfied.",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
20,"it's a beautiful coat and has a water-resistant element for light rain but it was pouring rain the other day and I so wet, the coat was zero help... I still recommend it as a fashion item, not something I'm going to wear if it's raining",4,,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
21,I just took my new purchase on a trip to Alaska. It was perfect!!! Can easily layer underneath. Excellent coverage for rain. So flattering and comfortable. Buying all colors:),5,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,Rain Rebel Jacket
22,"I have been looking for a longer rain coat and this one is great! The style is fantastic and, so far, the function has been great. I love the pockets and hood! I noticed the jacket has dried fairly quickly after I have worn it in the rain, but that may be the dry climate. I will test it when I am back east. I saw other concerns about the zipper, and while mine has not broken yet, it does stick and is not the easiest. That is why I am not giving this jacket 5 stars. I think it could also be a little longer, but I am 6 feet so I miss the days when Lululemon had more tall sizes available. This would be great in a tall option and I would buy every color, as I have already bought two in this one and I am moving back to a place where it rains a significant amount. It is also a great coat to throw on if it is just a bit chilly and you want a little warmth, but with style added.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
23,"This coat is a great addition to the closet! I never worry about walking in the rain anymore to the train. I also know I have a great sprint coat! After getting the chrome first (my new favorite spring coat), I purchased the black as well. Hood is large so your face is covered and if you want to cinch your waist in the cords in the side give you shape. The length is just right, not too long and definitely gives you the coverage you need in the rain walking to the train or through the city.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
24,"This is by far the best rain coat I’ve ever owned. It’s stylish, lightweight, waterproof and comfortable. I love it so much that when I recently lost it on a flight, I immediately ordered another one!",5,,55-65,Rain Rebel Jacket
25,"I bought this coat in black and have taken on several trips since. It is super light-weight so it packs well. It doesn't rumple so you can pull it out of the suitcase and it's ready to go! It's the perfect length to wear over jeans, over tunic tops or over core/yoga pants, yet with a scarf, it dresses up nicely for an evening out in a big city. I LOVE this jacket so much that I ordered one in burgundy, as well. I love that it's not too hot or heavy so it's perfect for mild summer climates when it might rain a bit or when I might need an extra light layer for a cool evening. The perfect jacket for so many occasions. It also cinches in at the waist, making it adjustable for extra layers worn under the jacket, or slims down in the waist with every pound lost!",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,OVER 65,Rain Rebel Jacket
26,"This jacket is the right length, the right cut, great waistline, feminine and then.... the zipper doesn't work! It gets stuck - or its impossible to zip up. Such a bummer - I mean it is expensive for a rain coat!",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
27,"This jacket is a simple, clean color with a flattering fit. It's warm enough for chilly LA mornings but breathable for warmer, rainy days. The hood has a stiff bill and is adjustable to keep my face and hair dry on a rainy commute. The pockets have a super soft lining for a cozy feel when it's chilly out. Only giving four stars because the pocket lining came torn - easy enough to sew up myself but annoying for a jacket at this price point.",4,,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
28,"I bought this cute rain resistant jacket in Canada when visiting Whistler during late ski season. I was so excited to have the light jacket for Seattle spring when we get lots of drizzles but it's pretty warm out. My husband and I are also traveling to Europe this summer and I thought it would be the perfect light jacket to pack for trekking around the Greek Islands after the sun goes down. Unfortunately I've only had the opportunity to wear the jacket a handful of times because the zipper broke. My friend had warned me that she had heard this was a problem with Lulu jackets, but I adamantly defended one of my favorite clothing brands! Well, the jacket got the better of me and the zipper got stuck at the bottom and there is nothing I can do to fix it. I can still step in and step out of the jacket, but it obviously has taken away most of the charm in looking so silly trying to get it on. I also can't wear the jacket with it open in front given the zipper is stuck shut at the bottom. Very sad as the fit and other materials seemed so perfect!",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
29,"I like the idea of this jacket, however, there is something to be desired in the execution. The sleeves are incredibly long, the shape (albeit a great length) is boxy and the zipper is not great to maneuver. This jacket was a big investment for me financially and I am left disappointed.",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
30,"I've always loved the jackets from Lululemon. The fit and quality is always worth the extra cost, until I purchased this one. Really disappointed in the quality. The fit is lovely but in comparison to the other 4 jackets I've had in the past, I wouldn't recommend this one. The zipper was tough for the first 3 weeks until it eventually broke!
Sadly, I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this one.",2,RUNNER,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
31,"Absolutely love the fabric as it is very soft, however since I bought the jacket I have had a hard time zipping up the jacket and yesterday the zipper finally gave out! Loved this jacket but would not recommend!",2,RUNNER,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
32,"Slimming, chic coat to keep you warm and dry and warm in all kinds of weather. Great coat for travel. It looks great with every outfit and doesn’t scream raincoat. And yet it is. Nice color choices, but I chose black because it goes with everything. This will be your go to coat when the weather is questionable.",5,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
33,This rain jacket is incredible and I would definitely recommend it to ANYONE!!,5,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
34,Sleek and functional. Love it.,5,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
35,"Absolutely love this rain jacket. Does a wonderful job repelling water, hood is great. Only thing I wish were different are the pockets everything falls out especially when you sit down. Wish pocket design were different.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,55-65,Rain Rebel Jacket
36,Bought this at full price. Worn it twice. The zipper constantly sticks.,1,YOGI,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
37,"LOVE this raincoat. Great fit. Sweatshirt fits underneath. I sweat, but NOT in this jacket. Great for TO's crappy cloudy, rainy spring. Zipper SEEMED sticky, but works great. Even for arthritic hands!!!!",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,Rain Rebel Jacket
38,"This is almost a perfect rain,waterproof coat, great for traveling, because it’s a bit roomy
you can wear warm clothing underneath.
The coat is truly waterproof, I got caught in heavy downpours several times and stayed
absolutely dry.",5,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
39,"I have MANY Lululemon jackets and absolutely love them all! This one, as much I love it, the zipper is terrible. It was a little sticky at first but I thought it just needed some wear. Now, I cannot get it undone, so I have to step into my jacket. Good thing is that I can still move the bottom one up but cannot undo it. Unfortunately, I bought this one on clearance, so could not return it.",3,YOGI,55-65,Rain Rebel Jacket
40,"I am a fan of the colour, cut, pockets and hood, but the zipper is really frustrating. Wish I had read more of these reviews before purchasing. Challenging to zip up and especially to unzip. The reverse zip barely works, which is too bad because I wanted to ride this on my bicycle. I would wait for the next version to come out!",2,,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
41,This jacket is perfect! I get so many compliments anytime I wear it. It fits wonderfully and looks slimming. 100% waterproof and a decent size hood that keeps the rain out when wearing it!,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
42,"I really love the jacket - perfectly lightweight for rainy spring days - got the jacket the less than a year ago, just before summer so i've barely worn it and the zipper broke so i can't wear it anymore. Pretty disappointing considering the price and how much i love it.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
43,"I love the jacket, don't get me wron g- but I am UTTERLY confused at sizing at Lululemon. One season I'm a 4, next season Im an 8 - theres not stretch in the chest anymore for ladies who have some, theres not stretch in the hips. My sizing changes with the coats of the season and I hope that you take this a valuable feedback to get some consistency.
Ill have to return in order to fit my chest in - even with a 26 inch waist.",3,YOGI,,Rain Rebel Jacket
44,This was the perfect packable rain coat to wear on my trip to the California central coast. I bought the coat one size larger so that I can layer under the coat. Love that I can cinch the waist and that it is right below my knees.,5,,45-54,Rain Rebel Jacket
45,I love this coat so much! I was looking for a lighter rain coat and was excited to find this. I have it in the green. It’s super soft and zips up easy. The cut is great and the zipper at the bottom allows you to sit down. Definitely give this coat a try if you are looking at it!,5,YOGI,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
46,I love how nice and simple this jacket looks but the sleeves are too short and too tight! I tried on one size up and it was way too big on me so the person helping me in the store told me to get my usual size and I've regretted it ever since. I can't wear a shirt under this jacket unless it's thin and tight which defeats the purpose of buying this coat because when it rains it's cold and this jacket doesn't have any insulation. I love all my other lululemon jackets but this one wasn't for me.,2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
47,"I have been on the hunt for a good, stylish rain jacket. I thought since I am usually happy with all my lulu purchases I would give this a try. Unfortunately this did not meet my expectations. The arms are short and the jacket is very thin. For the price I expected it not to be like a plastic bag.",1,YOGI,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
48,"Love this jacket! I previously had the Cloud Crush Rain Jacket, but this one is way better quality. The style is very flattering, and it has a thin lining on the inside that makes it a little warmer. Overall, great jacket and I definitely would recommend!",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
49,"This jacket fits perfect I usually wear 6/8 medium in Lulu and baught 8 medium in jacket. I love it, plenty of style and still
Functional",5,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
50,"I absolutely LOVED this jacket. Super comfortable, flattering and perfect for vancouver rain. Unfortunately within the first few months the zipper broke. I came in and got it replaced by my local store, but unfortunately the zipper broke on new jacket they gave me a few months after that. Sucks that such a weak zipper was used on such a great jacket :/",2,YOGI,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
51,"The jacket is so flattering. If you are looking for a cute light weight long jacket, then this one is perfect for you!",5,RUNNER,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
52,"I really like this rain jacket. I lost my prior lulu rain jacket and had to buy another one. While this one's fabric is a bit thinner than I'd like, the length and cut are very flattering. The sleeve length could be a tad longer and this definitely isn't a jacket to workout in. More for every day use when running errands/to and from trips in the rain.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
53,"Purchased for an upcoming trip to rainy UK and Ireland. Usually purchase a 4 or 6 in clothing, and the 6 fit really nicely but I really wanted to be able to wear a few layers with this jacket to get the most flexibility so I sized up to an 8. For reference I am 5'10 and 135lbs. The hood does gather (there is a little tab inside in lieu of a plastic toggle) and same for the back of the garment which is a nice detail, bringing the waist area in if wearing less layers! I also liked that this jacket is lined so it does't feel like a plastic bag on and features inside pockets on each side with zip closures, large enough for a phone and sunglasses. The fabric is smooth and hangs nicely. I also preferred that the jacket doesn't have any gathering detail around the wrist area. I do wish that Lulu could figure out the ongoing zipper problems. I purchased this in store and the first one I tried (and staff assisted) could not unzip at the bottom...",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
54,"I normally wear a Lululemon 6 but bought an 8 to wear over Irish knit sweaters that I favor this time of year for walks on the beach. It is perfect, and am loving the khaki green and the fit. The material and length of jacket keeps me dry with awesome hood coverage in light rain. Can’t wait to see how it works with forthcoming Ireland trip.",5,YOGI,OVER 65,Rain Rebel Jacket
55,"For reference, I'm 5'9"", 117-120 lbs. Street size 0/2, bra size 34A. Lulu 4 in bottoms (2 in Aligns) and 4/6 in tops.
I loved this jacket - the way it looked, the way it draped on the model online, the feeling of the fabric (different than my other Luly rain jackets), the more sturdy nature of it.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,Rain Rebel Jacket
56,"Got the email on Thursday that this jacket was out and went to the store to try in on on Monday. I loved the colour (Deep Ruby), the zipper issues I had read about on other rain coats seems to have been addressed, and the the ability to cinch it up in all kinds of places (especially the hood) was a great feature. The cut was very flattering as well. I also found the material to be thicker and more durable than the Cloud Crush Jacket. Sadly, I realized that a size 12 would be too snug with anything other than a very light sweater and a 14 would be the best fit if I wanted to wear a warmer/thicker layer under it. I rarely find size 14 in stores and they were all sold out in any of the colours online. I'm happy that Lulu is getting more inclusive with their sizing, I just wish they would make more styles and carry more inventory of those styles. I think the fact that the size sold out in 4 days would suggest that I'm not the only one who feels this way! Hope all you smaller-sized ladies grab this while you can!",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
57,"This jacket has great material that feels very durable and comfortable. I love the fit, although it doesn't stretch much with movement. Overall it was a good buy for spring weather.",4,,18-24,Rain Rebel Jacket
58,Good stays up! Stay warm and dry in whatever climate. I’d advise sizing up if you are more than a B cup.,5,,,Rain Rebel Jacket

60,Unfortunately the zipper does not work correctly. It's difficult to start the zipper and then I can't unzip from the bottom up. Please contact me on how to resolve this.,1,,,Rain Rebel Jacket
61,"This jacket is very light weight, no insulation at all. I think it would work in light spring rain in Vancouver. But definitley not up to the task of winter rain coat by ANY stretch. I would disagree completely with the other reviewer who says its a tent. I found it true to size. I'm a 6 or 8 in most lulu tops, sweaters and jackets, and the 8 fit well. If I had sized down to a a 6 it would have been too tight on the bottom. The arms are not long at all, in fact I think they're too short. And I would expect that you could adjust the cuffs, but there is no adjustment at all. Also no adjustment on the hood. Overall, I think for the price, this jacket is a terrible deal and I would not recommend until it goes on sale. I would expect something of this flimsy quality to be more like 125$.",3,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,Rain Rebel Jacket
62,"I bought this jacket because it looks amazing online.
I was vey disappointed. The jacket is huge. The sleeves are very long and
with no elastic around the wrist I couldn't function while wearing it as the sleeves
kept getting in the way.
You are able to cinch the waist but it then made me feel and look like I was wearing a tent because it lost all shape.

I can't think of any reason for this, and the place where I would expect to see some piling on almost any pant (inner thigh) remains perfect. This bothered me, at the $98 price point, because they were only about a month old at that point, and I am always very careful to wash my Lulu items in cold water and hang to dry so they retain their shape and condition. Today, I looked down and saw the seam is unraveling on my lower right leg, and that, combined with the piling, is what has compelled me to sit down and write a review. At $98 a pair, worn once every two weeks or so for the last 3 months (and cared for properly), this is not acceptable quality by my standards.

These pants stay in place the whole time and the waistband doesn't dig into me when I bend over. I love that I can wear them many times without them stretching out and they form to my body just right. They are sweat absorbing as well and they dry, pretty much instantly after a workout. I also enjoy wearing these to work since so I can stay comfortable. I am a preschool teacher so I am constantly running around and bending over to pick up children. These leggings can be paired with a nice sweater to look more professional so I enjoy that I can use them for multiple purposes.
Another thing that I wanted to mention is the fit of these leggings. They feel like a second layer of skin and usually when leggins are thin like these, they are see through. Theses aren't and they smooth out the skin so your imperfections, such as cellulite don't show. I find myself picking these pants over all my other workout leggings every time.
One thing that I don't like about these leggings is how much they start to pill in the crotch area. I only wore them twice before this started to happen and I followed the washing directions which say to not wash with cotton clothes, turn them inside out and let them air dry, but they still continued to pill. With how much they cost you would think that this wouldn't happen. Also, I am 5’6 but have short legs and the leggins are a bit long on me and bunch on the bottom of the leg.

I just can’t get rid of it, it makes me question the quality. 2. When I purchase them the seam of the ankle was already unraveling to this day still has hanging threads and a small hole. 3. I was stretching before dance and the inner thigh area ripped. Very unhappy with this pair of leggings, I can no longer wear them in public or at all because it’s poor quality.

If you don’t mind a little tightness is the shoulders go with a 4. There is not much difference in the length. It is very soft and cozy. I do dry clean a majority of my clothing so I cannot comment on how it washes. The color is fantastic and goes with leggings or jeans. I’ll be keeping both because it is such a nice sweater and depending upon the look I am going for that day will depend on what size I wear,5,,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

29,"I have been a dedicated lulu fan for over 10 years, especially the scuba hoodies. My favourite was the scuba II, when they added the side panels for proper fit and length compared to the first version. I didn't love the III because the pockets seemed weirdly long.
But I hate this new fourth version! Specifically the band at the bottom. I detest how it gets much wider at the back than at the front. It looks like the wearer is constantly arching their back and sticking their butt out. And it makes her bum look long. And the lopsided look when viewed from the side is awful. I really want to buy a new scuba because I lost weight and my old ones are too big now, but I hate this new style, I guess I have to wait for the 5th version to come out and HOPE that with it they go back to the regular single length band.
When will they make a scuba 5?!",1,DANCER,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

Living in Canada, I don't tend to use hoodies as jackets. For most of the year, (October to May) they're more of an all day, over a t-shirt/tank staple. I find the cuffs and forearms of this Scuba to be very tight and restrictive, so I'm unable to use this as a cozy, all day hoodie. In fact, I pretty much never reach for it at all - it hangs prettily on the hooks in my room. I tried to love wearing it, but the moment I went to wash my hands, do dishes, or anything where I'd want to pull my sleeves up a bit, I couldn't - the cuffs are too tight and inflexible. I basically have to take the hoodie off to do anything (or deal with damp , dirty hoodie cuffs which is especially annoying when you're out running errands and have to use the washroom/wash hands). When I put a hoodie on, I want it to feel like it's apart of me, not like I'm wearing a straight jacket. I have other brands of hoodies that are fitted and look great but are more versatile - those are the ones I reach for. I did try on a size up, however then the body was too big so it wasn't a viable trade off. Also, the bottom cuff that sits around my hips/waist area already looks stretched out after extremely minimal wear. I'm fairly petite/narrow in the hips too, so I feel as though this is the fault of the hoodie, not me or my sizing. I would expect this from a much less expensive hoodie, not this one though.

I have purchased many over the years, in all incarnations of the style-- the original, the 2, the 3, special editions, I even have a few of the remixes hanging around. The *Light version is one of my most favorites (a close second after some of the special edition releases like the sparkle, plush or embroidered.) The weight of this hoodie is perfect for the California weather. Not overly warm, but it gets the job done. I also love the fit on this version. It hugs in all the right places while still being comfy. I've been enjoying the feature where I can zip it all the way up to the top, and re-position the hood and neck part to act as a scarf when the temperatures dip at night. So far, I've bought 3 of the *Light (minkberry, plum and dark red). I'm considering picking up one of the bright pinks as well.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

I have it in grey, and my mom kept stealing it from me so I got her one in blue, that maybe I’ll have to steal occasionally. It is a snug fit, but it’s not uncomfortable at all. It doesn’t suffocate your chest or arms, which was a concern of mine since I have larger shoulders and arms. It keeps me warm and goes with almost anything. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it. I am 5’4, 135 lbs, with a curvy and muscular build. I got the size 8, but I got my mom the size 6 and I honestly don’t notice much of a difference.

I find they do stretch out some so if you like a tighter fit get your regular size or size down but if you like them a little roomier like myself I sized up one size.
My only complaint is the size 14 seems to be sold out within a few hours of coming out online and they don’t seem to have that size in store. Please make more size 14!!!!!! I want to buy more but can’t seem to get one.

There's even a little inner hole for [soon to be obsolete?] wired head phones. Considering it's a hoodie, the fit is actually pretty feminine. The sleeves, however, are too are form-fitting, and offer virtually no give/stretch. A lot of fabric bunches up in my inner elbow, thus making bending my elbows noticeable, even a little uncomfortable. Another reviewer mention you can't pull up your sleeves in this hoodie, and yup, they're correct.

I would have returned it then and there but since I had worn I figured I was stuck with it...fast forward 5 months later it looks faded and in poor condition when I have only worn once every two weeks for things like sitting at work or going grocery shopping. Definitely would expect old lulu quality for the $118! Although washed in cold water and hung to dry, the length had shrunk as well. Just overall poor fit as well.

She informed me that size 14 is a new size they are trialing and to gage how well it sells, they are offering it in different patterns on this particular hoodie before they offer it in these solid colors, such as the black I was seeking. Would it not be more successful to try popular solid colors first?

The material is thinner. I inspected the inner seams and workmanship and compared it to my most recent Scuba (purchased about two years ago). The older Scuba is vastly superior in quality. I tried on the new one. The armpit area felt restrictively tight, which had never before been a problem with Scubas. I tried to zip it up - the zipper was SO hard to put together at the bottom, the way cheap sweatshirt hoodies from H&M/Uniqlo are. I'm just so sorely disappointed in the quality. I will not be purchasing another Scuba unless they return to their prior level of quality.",1,RUNNER,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

I ended up calling and putting one on hold and sent my husband to go get it (this is how bad i wanted it).
Once i got home and tried it on, it felt sooo snug and super thin (remind you i have 4 of the same scubas with the same size), as if the quality isnt there anymore, and the length seems so much shorter. i am soooo disappointed with these new sweaters.

I ended up purchasing it anyway (the camo color is super cute), but now I am regretting it because I think the zipper is going to be an issue.

I still love them nonetheless. I haven't washed mine yet (I'm a bit afraid to).

I am 5'5 and tiny on top. I have always bought size 6 in hoodies. ALWAYS. for YEARS. however, I bought the blazer blue one in 6 and cannot believe how short it is. and oddly tight in places that don't make sense?? my weight is all in the trunk, so no reason this hoodie should be tight on me, if the size had stayed the same. I bought the submarine colour out of the 'we made too much' bin. the jewel tones shown in the pic would have been great on me. I sized up to an 8 because of my issues with the blazer blue. sadly when I received the submarine hoodie, the fit is better in length but otherwise is v v big on me......and the colour is more hunter green than anything jewel. I can wear bright and jewel (saturated colors) tones and almost anything in the blue/purple range but this is such a matte dark dark forest/hunter green that I'm never going to wear it. so now I have these beautiful hoodies that are going to take up space in my closet (sorry marie kondo ) and I can't wear them. wicked disappointing.

I have at least 2 hoodies that I have only had for a few months that have holes in the elbows. One has holes on both elbows- its just in shreds.
I don't understand why this is happening. I wash per instructions and air dry flat, I only wear them once a week and I know I'm not catching it on anything. Also, I ordered a size up so I know that its not ripping due to the fit.

- If you're picky like me, having a smooth zip is a plus when your hands are full of stuff.
- Overall, fit is true to size, but I made the mistake of ordering a size smaller than I normally would. For reference I am 145lbs, same height as the model, and got the size 6. It is fitted on me, next time I would get the size 8 for comfort.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

I was in New York last weekend and it was FREEZING and there is a Lululemon store on every corner so I popped in to purchase a warm hoodie to layer under my coat. I tried on a few colors in one particular store but didn't love any of them. A bit later we came across another store and they had a different color I liked so I grabbed the size I had tried on earlier in the color I love. We left, jumped on the subway and I put on my new hoodie but it felt tighter than the others I had tried on. I thought maybe I just needed to wear it for a bit but after coming home and wearing it around the house, it's still tight. Can't push my sleeves up at all, even to wash my hands, they are so tight and it feels really tight across my back. I'm bummed, I already took the tags off not even thinking the fit might vary from color to color even in the same size.

One discomfort is that the materials used for the arms do not have any stretch or spandex, unlike the body. This means you cannot roll up the sleeves when you're getting warm or want to adjust your sleeves from getting in the way. My arms are on the slim side and I feel it very constricting (unless I got a defective one?). So if you have bigger arms, I'd suggest sizing up one or two.",3,,,"Scuba Hoodie

A size 4 would've been good for a more loose fit on the wrists as the size 2 is a bit snug even with my abnormally tiny wrists (I can still fit my hand in a Pringles can to get the last chip).

Also isnt as soft as i thought as it seems to be advertised as breathable and soft which i find it to be neither. Im so sad because for the price i wanted to love it and for it to preform.

Overall a good shirt I think I just shouldn't have listened to the reviews. Hoping I can return and purchase the size 4 and then it will be perfect. I think that the hoodie is a great weight in that it is actually warm.

Not sure if that is just what was supposed to happen or not, but I end up wearing the other colors I own and those colors hold up really well in comparison to the black. Idk. Usually black hoodies fade, but I didn't think it would fade in a month or two of use. I have the defined jacket in black and that did not fade at all and I've had it for a while.

427,"I really want to love this Scuba like I love my original one but its just not the same quality. I cannot comment on how it washed and the longevity because I haven't actually worn it. I like the hoodie itself, but the seams around the cuffs have no stretch and even though I sized up because I like my hoodies loose, it is very difficult to get my hand in and out of the cuff. Then once I have it on, I can't push up my sleeve to look at my watch. So annoying!!!!!! These hoodies are completely overpriced to begin with, but since I loved my original one so much, I took the plunge. I may drop by the store if I get a chance to try some others on and see if mine was just a ""dud"". I'm torn as to if I should keep it - its a big price to pay for something that isn't perfect. :-(",3,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,"Scuba Hoodie

440,"First let me say then when I opened the package of my dark red sport scuba I was immediately disappointed. The color is nothing (nothing!) like the picture. The scuba I received is more of a cranberry/burnt orange. Not the bright beautiful red pictured above. I almost send it back right then. But being the lulu sucker that I am, I tried it on. Then ... yes, I ripped the tags off and kept it. I have since worn the sweatshirt almost all week.
It is so very soft and warm. Surprisingly warm. I really do love it (minus the color). I am 5' 9"", 130 lbs, 32 chest. I got a size 4. It is form fitting without being tight. For a more roomy fit I would size up. Also it is a bit short for me hitting right at the hips. I typically like longer, over the butt, tops.

It's also pilling under the arms after the 1st wash and wear which shouldn't happen with a $100 item. If it were a cheaper jacket I wouldn't expect more, but from lulu I do. I'm not sure if all colors are the same way, but mine looks like dingy and I just got it. Overall, sizing seems spot on. I'm a 10 and the 10 fit perfectly. I like the higher neckline and that you still have curves even though it's a little heavier then say the define jacket.

After a few wears and washes the material got more stiff and it would start piling. This is so unfortunate and disappointing that I dont think I would ever buy this hoodie again. I always try to air dry it or dry it on its own and not with other towels or other clothes to prevent it from piling but that seems to happen. Not happy with overall purchase especially for the high price its very disappointing.,1,RUNNER,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

Unlike the older hoodies, the fabric of this new hoodie is still warm but thinner and it has more give to it. The hoodie also seems longer than the older version, which I really like. The only thing I was unsure about was what size to go with. I am 5'8"" and 133 pounds. I tried on both the size 4 and size 6. The 4 fit snug while the 6 was a little on the looser side.

I couldn't even easily push the sleeves up to check my watch and I can't push them up to wash my hands either so its always getting wet when I wash my hands.

In the past, it seemed to be more tailored and fitted through the abdomen and the wider hip band seemed to give the illusion of a smaller waist.

As for the fit: This jacket was very tight. I'm 5'10""/140 lbs/34 B and I ordered this jacket in a size 6. It was tight, comparable to how my Define Jacket fits in the same size. The sleeves were also too short (which I don't have a problem with in my Define), so I was unable to use the thumb holes.
I would definitely try this jacket again, but in a different color and I wouldn't buy it without trying it on in store first. I can't speak to the durability because I returned the jacket.

Purchased pale pink & the color turned dingy even though I washed it per tag & was the only thing I washed. The waistband & the cuffs also looked terrible....got waffly & didn’t go back to how it first looked brand new. Also pilled on the sleeves after a few wears. I really liked it after one wear that I went back & purchased the dark grey version. I didn’t try it on figuring I already knew my size. The dark grey ended up running smaller than the light pink. I read the tags & both were made in different countries. Same size fit completely different! I returned the dark grey & purchased pale grey which was manufactured in same country as pale pink. They both fit the same. Grey hoodie looks better than my pink one after washing...not much pilling & color still looks good. Would love to know if I could return pale pink since I won’t wear it.....looks terrible.,2,RUNNER,45-54,"Scuba Hoodie

I have washed and I have hung to dry.....I am too afraid to put it in the dryer because I'm afraid it will shrink. I typically wear a 4 or 6 in Lulu's, and I got his in a 6. I could totally fit a 4, however the wrists are tight, odd, I know. The waist has plenty of room, but still looks fitted cause of the seaming detail...but the wrists and thumb hole are quite tight, they could not get any tighter or I couldn't fit my hand in it. sometimes my thumb will hurt after wearing it for a while. it is also not stretchy, so you cannot push up or roll up the sleeve to your elbows, which is kind of a bummer because I like to push up my sleeve in case I'm running to the grocery store or something and do not want my sweatshirt to touch the cart. Besides that, it in very flattering and I think if I sized up to an 8 it would be much to baggy in the waist. I do really love the look of this sweatshirt, but I'm hesitant on buying it in more colors because of the tight wrists and lack of stretch.

I wore it for an hour to walk my dogs and there is already pilling under the arms and along the sides. The material needs to allow for a hoodie that is soft AND durable so there isn't pilling after less than one day of wear.,2,,25-34,"Scuba Hoodie

So she's just stopped wearing it all together. I took a look at it, and it doesn't look the same as when I bought it for her, the quality has really declined in pigment and material. And I know she takes good care of her Lulu garments, washing the properly. She also mentioned that the zipper gets stuck from time to time and really frustrates her.

This Jacket is made for tall slender women, if you're not over 5'7, I don't recommend this. The arms on this jacket are abnormally long, as well as the torso. I am 5'3, and this jacket resembles a dress on me. The quality is great and all, but the fit is just unrealistic. Even with a size 8, the jacket is very snug around my bicep area, which isn't the most comfortable. Really bummed I ended up disliking this jacket so much, don't recommend.",2,,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

Even though they're ""light weight"", they aren't thinner and they don't wash or wear any differently. I really can't tell much difference between the two. I am a little annoyed though. I bought my first Scuba a year ago and the woman told me I should size up (because I'm chesty) and 'lululemon didn't really make stuff for 'people like us'"" (she was chesty too) so I left feeling like I had to size up to a 12 or walk away. I bought my first Scuba in a 10 because I was swimming in the 12 and I wish I had bought a 6, because that is my *actual* size.

746,"I have 2 pullover hoodies, a tunic, a zip jacket and a scuba III I bought last winter. Has anyone else noticed the evolution of the fabric in these over the years? My first 3 items were 95% or 100% cotton mixed with a little elastine for stretch. Then polyester started creeping in, from 25% to 30%. The fabric of the scubas is now described as ""Blended cotton,"" which is a deceitful way to describe a cotton and polyester blend of 70%/30%. The hang tag even says, ""Cotton fleece fabric is thick and warm."" It' not cotton fleece. It's cotton/polyester fleece which is the reason for all of the pilling and fading. Same fabric as $25 H&M sweatshirt. Nowhere in the fabric description online is the actual fabric content listed. I now realize the scuba which I haven't worn yet feels stiff and heavy with no give like a knit should. That's why the complaints about not being able to pull the sleeves up.

After carefully following the washing instructions as I always do with Lulu products I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the material. After only 6 days from my date of purchase my sweater no longer feels soft as it did when purchased and now has a rough/harsh texture as if I have had it for years. It also appears to be pilling/balling up on the sides after one wash. This sweater was quite expensive so I would not expect this to happen with a product from Lululemon.

I cannot even pull the sleeves up to wash my hands, and as a busy mom with young kids, this is not good. So it sits in my closet as I just don't find it soft or comfortable or durable enough to wear.

One thing I also love about my Scuba's is that the hood is super functional, and I've used it quite a bit! They stay on and really protect when needed. Well, when I tried using the hood of the new one it kept sliding off when the wind blew. Not good. Lastly, I must mention that I size up one size in these because I like the fit better. And whereas the lower sleeves are somewhat snug on all of them, this new one is TOO snug and drives me insane. Thank you for always standing behind your product and sending me a return label Lulu!

It was the right length, had super long arms, and wasn't overly big through the middle (which I often struggle with in women's tops in general).

Second, the sweatshirt itself is much shorter and boxier than my other scuba hoodies, this is a very unattractive look. Lastly, the hoodie fits very strangely because it is loose in the body, but tight in the upper arms and across the back and doesn't have the stretch that the other hoodies do(it feels like it is going to rip when you extend your arms).

835,"I'm a LLL newbie, just started wearing their products within the last year. So far I've been thrilled with everything. So happy with their clothing that I'm slowly transitioning my entire wardrobe into a LLL capsule collection. I have 3 scubas that I rotate through the week, wearing no other hoodie. I wear these all day, every day. They keep me warm in the well below freezing temps when skating or walking, but also don't become overly heated when I'm busy doing things indoors - work, shopping, etc... As I wear a scuba everyday and have 3 that I rotate through, I wash them very regularly. I turn them inside out, zip them up, use cold water, tide free detergent, hang dry and have had no issues with fading, stretching, piling, or anything. They continue to look brand new and I feel pulled together in them. I feel they are acceptable attire in any situation I find myself in as they do look so good and hold their shape etc...through the day. As I said, I'm a LLL newbie so I can't compare them to any past versions, but I absolutely love the Scuba Hoodie IV. My sizes are all over the map so I can't offer much assistance - I wear a 4 in the Scubas, 6 in the Swiftly, 4 or 6 in WU pants, and 2 in Studio Pants. The size 4 scuba fits nicely with a swiftly underneath, not too tight in the body. I do agree with the other reviewers that the cuffs can't be pulled up to the elbow, but I think that might help the hoodie keep it's shape so nicely.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

841,"I have to admit that I do own more than one of these because I do LOVE them! In general they are very comfortable, the high zipper in the front provides shielding on your neck when it's cold out and the hood is big enough to actually be worn as one. My debacle is with what happened after washing... I always wash my LuLu to the 'care instructions' (because when you spend as much money as we do - we should probably care for them like we care about them). I wash on gentle cycle and wash only my LuLus together since I don't want other clothes that might be too abrasive to chafe against the material. I also only hang dry or lay flat to dry, being sure to turn it over to make sure it dries in completion. As my review title indicates, I LOVE my scubas, but they dry very stiffly so the first wear or two you have to work the material back to softness. Not terrible... but something to know. One of my Scubas has just not held up, the logo design which 'shapes' the jacket looks as if the threading shrank in the wash and has created a weird 'crinkling' along the design. It's just so unattractive now. What I love about LuLu is the lines and the sleekness of their gear... but this jacket just didn't maintain it's shape which is very disappointing given the cost.",3,YOGI,25-34,"Scuba Hoodie

Keep in mind that this fabric appears to have two-way stretch, not four, so I can't push the cuffs up to my elbows, but the fabric feels really stable and unlikely to stretch out. (And yes there's a ribbed panel on the sides to let it fit snugly through the midsection.) Because of this it might be good to size up if you're between sizes for a looser and comfier fit.

- the wrists are so constrictive I can't even pull the arms up to wash my hands without drenching the cuffs
- the print has already faded on the cuffs, the bottom and the side panels after ONE washing, and the natural fiber color is peaking through, it looks cheap and ruins the continuity of the print (I was finally happy Lulu came out with another fun print, but alas, it wasn't meant to be)

893,"I purchased the Heathered Illuminight color, dusty light blue, back in october when my local lululemon have them on markdown. The fit started out as slim and as I kept wearing it, it loosened up a bit. Now the hoodie has a SLIGHTLY more relaxed feel in my chest and arms area. In the description it is mentioned that this hoodie is meant to have a relaxed fit, if that's not your preferred style then either size down or don't purchase it. I have not experienced any pilling or seams coming apart. The hoodie is expensive, even as a markdown, but it has easily turned into my everyday hoodie and I am planning on purchasing another one soon.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

896,Scuba hoodies from Lululemon have always been a go to for me however this one seems to made with a material that gets damaged quite easily. I always wash Lulu how they say with cold water and no fabric softener however the waist band and the bottom of sleeves where the thumb holders are seems to be very damaged. The material has become rough and has fuzzes coming out of sleeves everywhere. I defiantly suggest getting the older style/ material over this one any day.,1,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

I bought this in a pretty blue color, something new, and brighter than a typical black/grey color. I wore it several times before I washed it and it was starting to stretch a bit. I washed it like I was told to and air dried overnight. I literally put it in the dryer for 5 minn to ""fluff it up"" a bit. When I put it back on, I noticed some of the stitching come undone and pilling!!!!!! Are you kidding?? I spent over 100.00 on this top. Not sure what happened to all this ""quality"" everyone is talking about of Lulu, but this top is not a good example. Extremely disappointed and money lost.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

I have room in the sleeves to roll up once, or else it looks great unrolled with the thumb holes. The hood has plenty of room, and the length sits perfectly just below the hip.

899,"I had a few scuba hoodies that I lived in which needed replacements after nonstop wear over the last 4-5 years. Size wise nothing has changed about me. I’ve always bought size 8 due to my long arms. For reference, I’m 5ft 7, 130 lbs. I do have very long lean arms and broad shoulders. I tried this version on over a tank top and thought it was fine. I basically assumed it’d fit same as my other scubas so I didn’t examine the fit as much as I should have. I went to wear it to work over a thin t-shirt and by end of day I couldn’t deal with the fit. Too short in the arms and too tight throughout arms and shoulders. Way too big thru the chest and bottom especially compared to my old scubas. So clearly sizing up would not fix this issue. Ugh! It reminded me of having to borrow my mom’s coat. Well problem solved because I gave this to my mom who is very petite at 5ft 2 /125lbs. As for me...I found an awesome hoodie from a competitor we shall not name in a size small given that brand runs long for my type of people. Lulu, please make tall sizes if you plan to make the regular sizes fit like petite sizes. I will say my mom loves this hoodie and wears it nonstop.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"Scuba Hoodie

I have washed on cold/gentle cycle and hang dry. It has held up for the most part (for about 1.5mo), but the bottom cuff is really starting to get stretched out, and the torso has shortened/widened. I sized much more up than my normal (usually a 6 in tops, bought a 10) to get the long and slouchy fit, and I'm really sad by how much the bottom has stretched and how much shorter in the torso it is.

This version fits perfectly - it is fitted in all the right places, and the length is perfect - not too long and not too short. The fleece is super-soft unlike the heavier, more bulky versions, and it is super-warm. The metal zippers are much appreciated as well!

I was disappointed when I went to the lululemon store looking for these hoodies as I wanted to purchase more. They don't exist!! The replacement (scuba hoodie light cotton fleece) doesn't even come close. The hoodie is poor quality and very thin. I have read of poor quality, stretching, and piling. This hoodie is equivalent to what you could get at a discount store or box store such as walmart.

But oh, well, I got used to it and said goodbye to the cute details and awesome quality. Now the scuba IV, that changed its name to light fleece, it's exactly that, a light fleece jacket that has nothing to do with what a scuba was. I wouldn't mind, but the price is higher, the quality is lower and the style is so different that I would get a real scuba anyway, but I don't have the choice. If you own any of the old ones, don't expect that quality, weight and warmth. I have black currant and dark olive (both recent releases) with the elbows already stretched.

These seem like the Scuba babies of the Scuba III and the ""On The Daily"" hoodies I love so much. (the softer colors: Fatigue, Heathered Gris) I ended up buying the Viola Scuba in my usual 6. It's very soft on the inside. The center interior panel as well as the interior of the sleeves has that soft fluffy fleece that is reminiscent of the Scuba II....only thinner. There are the classic stretch side panels, again, thinner.....the interior panels that are against your tummy when zipped are made of a nice flat cotton material. Metal zipper, deep pockets with ""key"" pocket, cool new zipper pull with a longer hair tie than usual attached. The sleeves are the perfect length for me and the thumholes have great placement as well and aren't made of that thicker fabric that gets ""fluffier"" over time and can be bulky in my palm (at least for me and my mini-hands!). I'm 5'4"", 125lbs with a small waist, mini bewbs and average hips. This Scuba was not bulky/billowy around the bewb or tummy area for me.

910,"I LOVE the Scuba 3 hoodie!!!! I HATE the Scuba 4 hoodie. I am a die hard Lulu customer, however I must say I am getting annoyed with Lulu for changing the names and the quality of their merchandise. Please be more respectful to your customers. In the last month I have purchased three Scuba hoodies. I purchased a Scuba 3, which I love. It fits great and washes amazing. I also purchased two Scuba 4's. You can imagine my sadness when I realized that the quality of the 4's is inferior. The fabric felt thin, doesn't have much shape, looses its shape, stretches out, the cut and style is much different, even the pockets are different. I figured if I washed them maybe they would soften and thicken. Nope, I can't believe I purchased 2 hoodies at $118 that are so poorly made. If I wanted a thin hoodie I would have gone to a discount store. For $118 I expect a beautiful hoodie, I expected that the Scuba 4, would have been like the Scuba 3, but better. Wow, was I wrong. And clearly by reading the reviews I am not the only customer that thinks this way. What blows me away even more is the fact that after your customers called you out on how you made the Scuba 4 cheaper, your marketing team decided that instead of correcting the problem you would just change the name to try and salvage some sales. What two weeks ago was called the ""Scuba 4"" is now the ""Scuba Thin Cotton Fleece"". Seriously??? By calling it thin now customers can't complain that they didn't know it was thin.

The material was thicker and perhaps more stiffer, probably due to the thickness but it kept my body heat close with no air gaps. It is the perfect go to for any cool day/night outing or place. The new design does not feel any different than a much cheaper hoodie minus the zipped up through the neck feature. Multiple layers underneath my old Scuba IVs is not necessary, wearing one top is enough. The new design requires me to wear more underneath to fill in the gaps and thinness of the material.

I just would like one 27 inches or so in a size 4 or size 6. 28 inches max. It's like they only design hoodies with boring colors that are boxy and too cropped. This is not terrible, but it's a bit bulky and not as soft and cozy as it could be. Please bring in a bit longer scubas like the stride--but cozier and some fun brighter colors.

The shoulders and chest were usually too tight and the length was always changing from too short to too long. This one is just right! I usually buy size 8-10 and have recently been getting the 10 in the previous scubas, to account for the tight shoulders and chest, but found they looked to sloppy.

932,"So I wasn't stoked when the scuba 4 replaced the 3 (as the 3 is amazing!) but I thought I'd give it a chance. I don't care that the 4 is shorter. I don't care that the OM looks more masculine. And I don't care that it looks boxier than the 3. I can live with all of that. BUT I do care that the sleeves are awful. I wear lulu leggings to avoid having to wear leg prisons (aka pants) but here is a sweater with arm prisons for what used to be the comfiest hoodie you make. The sleeves on the scuba 4 have ZERO stretch, it's ridiculous. I like to pull my sleeves up like 1.5-2 inches from my wrist so they doesn't hook on my laptop or binder in class as I'm taking notes. The scuba 3's are amazing for this, not a problem. The scuba 4? Yea right. I can't pull the sleeves up at all, I literally (no joke) broke a nail trying to pull the sleeve up at all and it still wouldn't budge. If I'm paying $130 for a hoodie, I want it to have some stretch and not be restrictive and uncomfortable. Now for background, I'm fairly average sized (tts 6), I don't have super muscle-y arms but I don't have big arms either, they're quite average, and they sleeves are way too tight on me. So I can't imagine how women who actually have any muscle in their arms deal with this, they'd probably rip the thing open. Also I have tried a size up (the 8) and it's absolutely huge on me so that doesn't solve the problem. I tried to give them a chance and I have now purchased 6 scuba 4's hoping that it was just particular colors that sucked and others would be better. Nope. They all have this problem (I have white, dark olive, illuminight, garnet, pelt, and nocturnal teal). Super disappointed. I won't be purchasing any more scubas until this gets fixed which is unfortunate because I have like 20+ Scuba 3's since Canada gets pretty cold and they're perfect for our weather. So please lulu, fix the sleeves cause this is ridiculous for the money we pay for a plain basic hoodie AND considering that you got the sleeves right in most of the scuba 3's (chilled grape, bordeaux drama, heathered darkest magenta, black, heathered light grey, heathered deep green, brave olive, exc --> all awesome hoodies with awesome sleeves).",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

941,"I was so excited to splurge on a new Scuba Hoodie after losing some baby weight (not enough that I fit into my old hoodies just yet). I bought this in store and the sales rep and I both agreed that the 6 fit better than the 8. Brought it home and stashed it in the closet for the first fall day. I pulled it out yesterday and am bummed. The armpits are a bit restrictive, I think in part due to the piping around them. And, when I go to push up the sleeves when changing diapers or feeding my twins, it's impossible to push them up! Not stretchy at all. Between that and the tight armpits, I'm not sure I will get much use out of this.",2,,,"Scuba Hoodie

942,"Dear Lulu,
I bought the IV in boysenberry and it came all the way from Kelowna, so thank you for accommodating my order (it took a little investigative skills to find out it was already here waiting for me, no one called or emailed to let me know it has arrived, but that's no big deal). That was my first hoodie purchase in a couple years since I was not impressed with the fabric or the look on the III models. I have been wearing it for about a month now and here is my 2 cents: Lulu, please don't mess with a good thing ... ever again! You had it right the first time; hoodie I & II were great, the logo shaped cut on the front had a nice ribbon/trim on top of the seam that was not only functional, but offered an extra level of detail. It kept the front flat and made the logo shaped cut more visible. In the #4 model, the trim is missing, which combined with a softer fabric results in a cheap, almost kitchen cloth-like hoodie. At least for my shape and size, every time I look in the mirror I notice a bulge on my chest, although the fit on the shoulders is good. If I want to look cheap, I can wear any track top without spending $ 132! Hope this helps, and I look forward to buying more colorful hoodies (I remember there used to be so many beautiful bright colors, and prints, it was hard to decide) , with improved fabric & design, even if that means bringing back the ""old"".",3,YOGI,45-54,"Scuba Hoodie

943,I bought the III and IV to compare and I would say that the III is my favorite of the two. I really like the Heathered speckled black color but my main complaint with this is that the arms are not very stretchy at all. I have muscular arms and I need a little more room in the shoulders. I sized up to an 8 in this and it fits but I feel restricted in the arms when I move or bend at the elbow. Its not terrible but the stretchier arms in the III are MUCH more comfortable.,4,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"Scuba Hoodie

It's comfortable, but the quality has dramatically decreased within the Scuba line over the years, which is really disappointing because they are my favorite hoodies :( Now i'm stuck with a $100 hoodie that I won't wear anymore because the color looks as cheap as something I purchased from a thrift store.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"Scuba Hoodie

It's summer in Japan now, so I've only gotten to wear this less than 10x. I'm really really disappointed considering how much more expensive Lulu products are here.

At first it was small enough that I had decided just to ignore it but I wore it one more time (for a grand total of approx. 12 wears) and it became too noticeable to ignore.

This sweatshirt however doesn't even come close when comparing to the others in terms of quality & craftsmanship.

The IV is VERY different. The sleeves are a bit shorter, the material is lighter, the hood is a different shape, and the classic Lulu insignia on the front is really subtle. I'm pretty much okay with the changes. I kinda like the new fabric (not as restrictive). The only things I definitely hate are the new pockets, WHY is the lining not fuzzy??

At first, I just went with it and decided to give it a try (thinking I would be able to exchange to the larger size if it turns out to be uncomfortable, but turns out that was a no go). After washing it ONE TIME, it shrunk on me! Making it a very uncomfortable hoodie to wear and the fact that it costs $118... it should be the most comfortable hoodie in the world! I did not dry the hoodie, I never dry my clothes in the dryer because I am already fearful of the stuff I love shrinking. It's super cute, I just wish it would have kept it's original size :/ (ps...

Compared to the scuba II's - the scuba IV is more relaxed and not as tight as the scuba II. The scuba IV seems to have a bit of a shorter arm length, and more room in the midsection compared to scuba II. I don't find the material to be too thin at all, and like the softness of the material (the material doesn't feel as stiff). It does look like a bit of a plain hoodie, but that didn't bother me too much. I ordered another two scuba IV's in other colours and feel like I could wear this hoodie every day as it's so comfy.

It's pretty uncomfortable and makes it really not practical (what if I want to wash my hands in this hoodie and not get my sleeves wet? etc.) I'm so upset because I didn't realize this until after the tag was off and I'm outside the return window anyway.

1022,"First let me start by saying that I would NEVER pay $118 for a cotton hoodie; that seems absurd. So, I'll tell you how I ended up with this one. I wear Lulu clothing all the time, every day, in fact, except my hoodie. I have lots of different brands of hoodies that run the gamut from NorthFace to Prana, but the one I wear most is a Mountain Hardware hoodie. I love it. It's comfy and warm but never makes me sweat. The problem is that it's pea green -- which isn't actually a problem for me but for my daughter. She HATES this bright pea green hoodie. My second favorite is an Adidas hoodie in orange (which she hates as much) and my third favorite is a North Face in silver, which she doesn't object to but which isn't as comfortable as my green Mountain Hardwear hoodie -- so my ""go to"" hoodie is always that green one. So for my birthday this year, my husband took her shopping and she bought me this $118 hoodie in black. I gasped when I saw the $127.86 receipt on the table the next day but didn't say anything and didn't want to return it because she was so pleased with herself for having chosen it. Long story short, I've had it on every day since my birthday. I love it -- yes, as much as the Mountain Hardwear hoodie. It is warm and comfy and I'll admit, it looks a whole lot nicer and the fit is much better than all my other hoodies. I am 5'2"" 115 lbs. and wear a 4 in everything Lulu (except vests, which smoosh my 32DD chest) but my daughter bought me a 6 in this. She said she's so used to my clothes, that she tried on the 4 and the 6 at the store, and the 6 seemed to fit more like my other brand hoodies, and so she took a gamble and sized up. So glad!! A 6 is perfect in this item. Because the sleeves are cut more narrow than most hoodies, the 4 would have scrunched up the sleeves of t-shirts underneath. And when I wear a hoodie I'm wanting to be comfortable and casual, meaning having a little extra space. By no means is this hoodie loose or baggy; it's a perfect fit. I'd strongly recommend buying up a size in this product -- and that's something I almost never recommend. In the end, I'd have to say that this hoodie is worth the almost $130 (gulp) paid for it.",5,YOGI,45-54,"Scuba Hoodie

The midsection is oddly baggy. When zipped up the shoulders are a bit too snug and the waist fits fine, but the middle was extremely baggy and made me look like I have a beer gut. My waist completely disappeared.
I can't be completely sure, but I also think the sleeves were shorter than previous versions. My arms were too long to use the thumb holes on this version, where I've never had a problem with my older versions.
Even if the fit was the same, the quality of the material wasn't there. This version feels very thin compared to the older ones. The fabric was a little bit softer, but I believe too much warmth was sacrificed.

1054,"This hoodie is okay. For reference, I am 5'9.5"" and about 165 lbs. and bought a size 10. However, I can't tell you how unbelievably frustrated I am by the fact that Lululemon seems to rarely continue certain designs. I bought two Stride hoodies I was in love with...they were longer all over and had a separate neck zip up and then a hood attached...amazing. I also had an fantastic simplistic running jacket from years back and a hiking short that was actually a long length that I've worn to the ground. I love and want to support the Lululemon brand, but i can't tell you how frustrated I am with the ever changing designs and ever increasing price. This hoodie works, but it is not even close to what I've had from here before, but unfortunately there are no other options. I'm sure others love this hoodie, but different body builds and heights require different options. Sometimes simple is just better. And us taller gals, sometimes appreciate a longer length in a more roomy short.",4,RUNNER,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

1055,I have always loved the Scuba Hoodie. I have a few in great colors. I do size up so I can layer underneath but the new style is more roomie. I could have sized down. I was surprised to see the material is cheaper and much thinner; more of a typical sweatshirt weight and feel. What I loved about the previous Scuba was it was not a sweatshirt in the usual sense. The new adjustments have moved it much more toward a typical sweatshirt. I miss the heavy weighted fabric and fleece lining. The larger hood is a great plus and the colors are still fun. The quality change is noticeable.,2,RUNNER,35-44,"Scuba Hoodie

Secondly, I thought the material seemed a little thinner than normal Scuba hoodies (this is the 4th one I have owned). I was a little disappointed.

At first I loved it, but after wearing it not even 3 times I discovered I had some serious pilling going on underneath my arms and on the sides of the hoodie. I figured this must be a faulty hoodie and took it in and exchanged it as I had not washed it yet, nor had I even layered it with another jacket or backpack to create friction for the pilling to occur. Fast forward a month, I had since received a new scuba hoodie in exchange for my pilled one and now after maybe 8 wears (with same care and no wash yet) the pilling is back! I want so desperately to be satisfied with this hoodie because I love the way it looks on but I just can't justify having spent the $$ and get so much pilling in so few wears!

This isn't a tight-fitted, tailored sweatshirt as noted in the description, so it has a more cozy feel to it.

Unfortunately, I am thoroughly disappointed. I could barely get my hand through the armhole of the sleeve! Once it was on, it was okay, but not exactly comfortable. The sleeves can't be moved because it is so fitted. For reference, I am 5'8, 160 lbs. I have a very small frame up top, usually a small-medium in tops and have issues with the shoulders being too big. I ordered a size 8 and it fits fine through the body, but the shoulders are TIGHT! It's bizarre. For an active clothing line, you'd think there'd be some more give in the fabric. It pulls so much across the back with the slightest of movements in my arms. It is short in the torso, also. I don't know whether to size up, or just return it all together.

I bought a size 4 in black, and I got fit in store and the rep said it was the right size for me. After one wash, I can no long even get my forearms to fit inside the sleeves. I let all of my lulu dry flat (I never use a dryer) and never use fabric softener, and I was still shocked by how much the hoodie shrank.

I've never been able to push the sleeves up but thought they'd stretch. This thing is made of cotton so should stretch but no, they've actually gotten tighter after the wash. I tried wearing a long sleeved shirt underneath but I got so physically uncomfortable with the pressure on my forearms I have to take it off immediately. That's $128.00 taxes not in for this hoodie.

But the fit was good and overall I was happy with the hoodie, I really wanted a black hoodie and my III had faded and piled so badly that it was not wearable in public and since this was a different fabric didn't think I would have the same issue and I don't think I would have. So my ordered arrived, I tried it on zipped it up....fit as expected so I pulled off the tag and figured it would be added to my hoodie collection. Later that day I pulled it on to walk to the mail box reached down to tie my shoes and my arms could not move, compared the two hoodies and curved seam on the black set about 2 inches higher on each side than the speckled gray making arm movement completely restrictive. I am not a big girl 5'9"" - 128lbs and a 32C. I should have plenty of room in a size 6, thankfully I showed the problem to my local store and they gave me a credit. Sadly all the whites and blacks in store had this same seam issue.

Once again, Lulu is sadly phasing out their beloved classics to 'upgraded' versions made with cheaper fabric, a poorer fit, and increased price. I have been a Lulu fan for about 8 years, and it is a shame to see how the company has changed. The classics such as the Scuba and CRB never needed to be changed at all. The original Scuba had a great, very flattering fit with high quality material, not to mention beautiful prints. The Scubas I still have still look the same, minus some color fading from years of washing/wearing. It felt great to have a comfortable, warm hoodie while still feeling feminine. Don't get me started on the CRB - that's another well loved Lulu classic that was changed for the worse for no reason. Whatever happened to the Still pant? The Cuddle Up jacket? The Cabin long sleeve? Lulu's cotton shirts nowadays are so thin and fragile I feel nervous just wearing them around the house.
