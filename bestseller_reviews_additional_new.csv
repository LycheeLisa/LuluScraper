0,I have it in every colors ! I juste LOVE it. Took 1 size down of my usual size.,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,MONTRÉAL,MUSCULAR,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
1,"Great fitting tee. Had to size down 2 sizes. Please make this in more colours - a royal blue, burgundy and grey would be great!",5,,,,,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
2,"The reviews on this tee are actually really helpful! I would agree that you should size down, or two sizes down from your normal size - it will still be a nice over sized fit! I usually wear a 12-14 in Lululemon tops depending on the style, I bought a 10 in this and it's a great fit. Lots of chest room without a bagging stomach area for my busty friends out there. The fabric is also the perfect blend of cotton and spandex feel! I'll purchase every color.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,CANADA,CURVY,"AUGUST 15, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
3,"The light material is perfect for hot weather! I am 5'7 and normally wear a size 4 however, I liked the fit of the 2 better. Would love to see more colours!!",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,,ATHLETIC,"AUGUST 14, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
4,"I purchased 2 of these, was so tired of the swiftlies and wanted something not so fitted. These are huge and stretch out like no other I own. I too wish there were reviews before I purchased.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,NEWFOUNDLAND,CURVY,"AUGUST 9, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
5,I purchased 3 of these tees and I love them very much! The fabric is light and airy and the fit is awesome. Highly recommend!!,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"TORONTO, ON",ATHLETIC,"AUGUST 6, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
6,"the sleeves are longer, the body is boxier, its very on trend. the white is sheer but I don't mind.
I would say i wear a 12-14 in lulu tops, and i bought a 10 in this.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"CRANBROOK, BC",CURVY,"JUNE 18, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
7,"Just like the other reviews say: it runs big!! I normally wear a size 8 when it comes to the tighter fit tops like the Swiftly Tech, but a size 6 in lose shirts like the Love Tees. With this shirt, I decided to size down to a 4 after reading the reviews and I am glad I did because it fits perfect, just how it looks on the models. I hope Lululemon comes out with more colors!!",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA",CURVY,"JUNE 14, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
0,"I typically don't mind spending the money on Lululemon pants as they are usually high quality and stand up to workouts however this time I was quite disappointed. After the first wear my align pants started pilling in the crotch and all along my inner thighs. It has gotten worse every time I wear them and now I no longer want to wear them to classes as they look awful. I asked in store about this recently and was told by an employee that they aren't meant for wearing.
I am upset as I love the feel of these pants but not the quality and now have a $100 pair of pants that I am not wearing due to pilling despite only wearing them a handful of times.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"EDMONTON, AB",ATHLETIC,"JANUARY 5, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
1,I was so excited about receiving these for my birthday a few months ago. This is my first pair of aligns and the comfort is definitely there but I gave it 2 stars since I have followed the washing directions like I have with my other lulu items since day one and I've sadly already noticed quite a bit of piling since getting them in June. The material is comfortable on but it seems to pile much more than other fabrics.,2,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"KELOWNA, BC",PETITE,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
2,I bought these for myself in my true to size pants. All my lulu gear is size 4 but these have bagged and I have camel toe when I wear them now. I didn't know I needed to size down because they give so much because of the material. Wished I owned them in a 2 :( bummer.,1,RUNNER,18-24,"HAMILTON, ONTARIO",SLIM,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""

4,"Align leggings are to die for! The material and fit is like no other pair of leggings I've ever tried. However, on my most recent pair of leggings I found the material to be thinner maybe than others? More susceptible to flaws. I have found that the slight brush against something a little rigid completely snagged these leggings. Other Lululemon leggings are way more susceptible to everyday wear and you don't have to worry about watching were you sit 24/7. Super sad because I do love how they fit and how the material fits just not ideal for (any performance uses, as they tell you when you purchase) but always not for everyday wear either :(",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,,ATHLETIC,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
5,I like the pants but they started to pill and sort of fray in between the legs. I tried the aligns for the first time and I would definitely stick to other leggings.,2,RUNNER,18-24,CANADA,ATHLETIC,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
6,"I was so excited when purchasing my first pair of aligns as I heard it's a staple from Lululemon. Pro: The material is very soft and comfortable, which allows room for flexible exercises. Cons: I noticed slight piling when wearing my aligns to grocery shop. I did not think anything of it until a month later, the fabric in the inner thigh area is bumpy and has noticeably thinned out. I usually wear them for quick errands/yoga days. I throw them in the washer on delicates and hang dry them. So I'd like to say I have taken care of them accordingly. Overall, I'm very disappointed as I loved them at first. However, I wish the $100 quality of the material lasted as it quickly deteriorated. Perhaps it's more suitable for people who's legs don't rub together when walking.",2,YOGI,25-34,"TORONTO, CA",ATHLETIC,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
7,"My favourite leggings! I love them for every day wear. However, they have seemed to piled a lot in a very short period of time, especially between the thighs. The material also does not have much strength - a small hole in the thigh has gotten increasingly larger and the leggings are no longer wearable... definitely not impressed with the outcome. But did love the initial purchase! That being said, probably would not buy another pair due to the end result.",3,DANCER,18-24,"REGINA, SK",CURVY,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
8,"Ce pantalon est parfait pour la vie de tous les jours, dans vos activités diverses. Toutefois, la journée que je les ai portés pour une séance d'entraînement... je n'ai pas du tout apprécié le confort du tissu - c'était comme s'il ne laissait pas respirer ma peau. Une drôle de sensation. J'aurai également dû prendre une taille plus petite, puisque ce pantalon ne reste pas en place - il a tendance à descendre lors d'exercices physiques intenses.",3,RUNNER,18-24,SHERBROOKE,ATHLETIC,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
9,"I loved these pants so much I decided to buy another pair, but unfortunately they wore through so much faster :(.

10,"Very disappointing, the align pants are so see through that I cannot wear them outside my house. Not just the bum but the legs as well are so see through! So I can wear them for yoga inside my house but who wants to spend $90 on yoga pants that no one can see you in?

11,These leggings are disappointing. I have bought from Lululemon the last 15 years. The quality of these is awful. Pilling after a couple wears on inner legs and the material wears out so quickly.,2,,25-34,,ATHLETIC,"AUGUST 30, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
12,"I bought these leggings in hopes to enjoy the lightweight feel when working out, but after only a month of wearing them, there was extreme pilling everywhere.

In addition I began to realize pilling along the pant.",2,,,,,"AUGUST 23, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""

These pants are so comfortable, but the quality is not the same as the first pair I got many years ago. The pilling is non-stop no matter how much I use my Conair Fabric Dufuzzer.

My hubby bought me these for a Christmas gift and within a few wears, there was already piling in the inner thighs.

I normally would wear a 12 in most Lulu clothing but I needed to size down becuase they ended up being too baggy. When I slid the 10s on, boy did they go on like butter, so smooth and so comfortable. I walked along the boardwalk at the Toronto beaches with my boyfriend later yesterday evening and boy am I ever happy I bought them. So breathable, easy to move in... I haven't experienced the pilling as others have been reviewing about, but I mean... My thighs rub together naturally when I walk so all of my work out pants/jeans/sweat pants pill.

24,"I recently decided to purchase another pair of my favourite black align leggings in the crop version as they are my staple go-to-leggings from lululemon. I bought my original pair a couple of years back and they were amazing and have lasted for several years. However, when I bought a new pair recently, I've noticed that the quality was different from my original leggings and at first, I thought it was because I had to break them in since they were brand new; however, the more I've been wearing them and testing them out at the gym, I've noticed that the quality is very different from my original pair. The new one's are not as soft and does not feel like skin which was a huge disappointment for me. I don't get how the quality has gone down for lululemon leggings but the prices have gone up and feel as though the leggings are quite different from what they used to be in the past.",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"VANCOUVER, BC",SLIM,"AUGUST 18, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""

I loved these so much that about roughly three weeks to a month later I bought a second black pair, and then a third pair in navy. I have had all three of these pants for less than 6 months and the two black pairs are falling apart. The pilling on these pants is insane and way more excessive than I have ever seen in a pair of pants in my life.

1220,"I don't understand why there have been hundreds of terrible reviews for these pants. In my opinion they are one of the best pairs of lulu leggings you can buy. The fabric is extremely soft, it feels like you are wearing nothing. I wear these to hot yoga and they are perfect because they are so thin your sweat evaporates right through which cools your body temperature down. I also wore these to boot camp class and they held up perfectly (no sliding down or pinching). As this material is super thin and delicate I would never suggest putting it through the washer because it will ruin it as many reviews below have said so already. Instead, I hand wash mines each time and hang to dry. I have seen NO PILLING at all and I have had these for a month and hand washed multiple times. If you are hesitating to buy these, I would definitely recommend you give them a try. However DO NOT put them in the washing machine, even if it is on delicate. Washing machines cause a lot of friction, thus rubbing the lulu fabric together causing it to pill very fast. Also, since the material is extra soft and stretchy, I would suggest downsizing!

I am super careful with them and thus I haven't had any issues with pillings with my most recent bought aligns (I own like 4 of them). I think most people get pilling with theirs is probably because of rubbing onto other materials of clothing.

These literally start to pill after the first wear and the threading starts to look worn and cheap! This seems to be a common complaint with lululemon products, especially the Align's. I would also like to point out that I take really good care of them. I wash them inside out and separately from all of my other clothes on a delicate cycle in cold water, then I allow them to hang dry. They are pretty high maintenance and still nothing I have done has prolonged the quality. I finally decided to write a review (which I never do) after having to exchange my last pair. I wore them for a total of two hours at a friends house for dinner and the threading was starting to come loose! The employee that I was dealing with tried to talk me into exchanging them for a different, higher quality style that would suit me better. I was a little annoyed as these are my absolute favorite comfort-wise. The quality should be there for EVERY single style at that price point regardless of how they are being worn. For the record, I've also owned a pair of Wunder Unders. They were less comfortable, pilled, AND faded. With that being said, I think I've given up on lululemon completely. The quality of their product needs to improve before I drop another $100+ on a pair of leggings that don't hold up while being worn lightly. Also, while contacting the GEC is extremely helpful and I've always been satisfied, I will say that having to constantly explain how the quality just isn't holding up, wait for a solution, and send them back is starting to become extremely tedious.",2,,,"VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA",CURVY,"OCTOBER 8, 2017","Align Pant II 25"""

1484,"My friend who lives and swears by these pants recommended them to me for yoga and basic lounge and I loved them so much that I bought a second pair in black 20 days ago.. I brought them with me as regular lounge pants for a 3 day trip to the States (with minimal action) and by the time I came back there were white pill balls in the crotch area. I brought it to a local Lulu store and felt shamed by the associate, who basically stated that these pants were only for yoga and that they were not meant for any higher impact activities that may involve thighs rubbing together (I had gone to a bouldering studio for the first time during my trip but was too afraid to really do anything other than sit and watch in awe) or for every day use and suggested I wear something else. He then told me that he has never seen these pants pill white and that it must have been human error instead of quality error even though I take care of these black pair the exact same as my other pair that had have no problems. He kept insisting this was a surprise to him even though many of the reviews and simple google searches show the white pill balls on the black pants. I ended up getting my exchange but I felt so embarrassed as if I was the one at fault for not being able to take care of $100+ pants. He even made the effort to loudly remind me that it was just for yoga as I was leaving. My friend who was with me and has never shopped at Lulu was fuming at how I was being treated, especially since these pants were barely worn and hadn't even been cleared off my credit card yet! I love these pants and how they make me feel especially in hot yoga but I'm afraid to even wear these exchanged pants in fear of it happening again since it seems like these pants weren't meant for people whose thighs touch. It bothered me so much that I've contacted GEC via e-mail and am waiting a reply as well.

The reviews obviously are less than stellar, hence my hesitation. Finally purchased some a few weeks ago.
If rating for comfort only, 5+ stars for sure. They feel amazing and I can't take them off.
I work from home and therefore wear these daily. They are great for everyday wear, errands, etc. The are very flattering and give a smooth, controlled look. I have a few trips booked this summer and they will definitely be coming along.
I do not wear them to workout. I have noticed many other reviewers reporting that they damage easily and show sweat. I can easily see that this would be true given the type of fabric. It just does not seem durable. I also do not think they would feel ideal for any type of high impact workout (I prefer compression style/feel, personally). However to be fair, the description does say these are designed for Yoga. For lower impact activities, I can see them working just fine.
I have washed them twice. There is some pilling in between the thighs/crotch area. I think this seems premature given how long I've had them, however part of me feels like that is to be expected considering the legs will rub together all.day.long. (no thigh gap here!) And I do wear them very frequently.
Overall- buy these if you do not want them for working out.

I then patiently waited until my next trip to the city (as our pop-up store closed after the summer), and when I brought them back to the store, was given the option to have them hemmed- which I did in desperation to be able to wear them again.
Now, forward three months, I am left with two pairs of these pants (one 1st generation ALIGN and one 2nd generation ALIGN)... both have very bad pilling, as well as the first pair has a large rip along the seam of the pants from crotch, down the thigh, and the second pair (previously hemmed) have strands of the stitching constantly coming lose, and I fear another rip along the seam of those pants.

She helped me pick out the right pair for me and suggested that I wash the pants and bring them back in so that I would swap them out. I did this, and went back in today, only to be told that I wouldn't be able to swap all pairs out, just 1.

As a bodybuilder, working out 5-6 days a week demands for high-quality workout gear to mirror my intense workouts, and this is why I primarily choose my gym gear from Lulu.

I rarely find size 14 in stores and they were all sold out in any of the colours online.
