I've noticed a bunch of reviews about them sagging/stretching out and I recommend selecting a size that is a very tight fit (I felt like I couldn't breath when I first put them on). They will stretch and I could see them falling down when you put something in the pockets if they weren't a too-tight fit to start. Also, these are designed for running, not yoga or weightlifting. They are made to spend a long time making the same repetitive movement and then take off. The fabric is very thin with a generous amount of stretch (to keep you comfortable while running) so if you are using them for something else you likely won't be happy with them. If you are training for a long distance race, these are a major go.

I've noticed a bunch of reviews about them sagging/stretching out and I recommend selecting a size that is a very tight fit (I felt like I couldn't breath when I first put them on). They will stretch and I could see them falling down when you put something in the pockets if they weren't a too-tight fit to start. Also, these are designed for running, not yoga or weightlifting. They are made to spend a long time making the same repetitive movement and then take off. The fabric is very thin with a generous amount of stretch (to keep you comfortable while running) so if you are using them for something else you likely won't be happy with them. If you are training for a long distance race, these are a major go.
