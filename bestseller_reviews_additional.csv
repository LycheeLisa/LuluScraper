0,I have it in every colors ! I juste LOVE it. Took 1 size down of my usual size.,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,MONTRÉAL,MUSCULAR,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
1,"Just like the other reviews say: it runs big!! I normally wear a size 8 when it comes to the tighter fit tops like the Swiftly Tech, but a size 6 in lose shirts like the Love Tees. With this shirt, I decided to size down to a 4 after reading the reviews and I am glad I did because it fits perfect, just how it looks on the models. I hope Lululemon comes out with more colors!!",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA",CURVY,"JUNE 14, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
2,"The reviews on this tee are actually really helpful! I would agree that you should size down, or two sizes down from your normal size - it will still be a nice over sized fit! I usually wear a 12-14 in Lululemon tops depending on the style, I bought a 10 in this and it's a great fit. Lots of chest room without a bagging stomach area for my busty friends out there. The fabric is also the perfect blend of cotton and spandex feel! I'll purchase every color.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,CANADA,CURVY,"AUGUST 15, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
3,I purchased 3 of these tees and I love them very much! The fabric is light and airy and the fit is awesome. Highly recommend!!,5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"TORONTO, ON",ATHLETIC,"AUGUST 6, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
4,"the sleeves are longer, the body is boxier, its very on trend. the white is sheer but I don't mind.
I would say i wear a 12-14 in lulu tops, and i bought a 10 in this.",5,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"CRANBROOK, BC",CURVY,"JUNE 18, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee

6,"I purchased 2 of these, was so tired of the swiftlies and wanted something not so fitted. These are huge and stretch out like no other I own. I too wish there were reviews before I purchased.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,NEWFOUNDLAND,CURVY,"AUGUST 9, 2019",All Yours Boyfriend Tee
7,"I typically don't mind spending the money on Lululemon pants as they are usually high quality and stand up to workouts however this time I was quite disappointed. After the first wear my align pants started pilling in the crotch and all along my inner thighs. It has gotten worse every time I wear them and now I no longer want to wear them to classes as they look awful. I asked in store about this recently and was told by an employee that they aren't meant for wearing.
I am upset as I love the feel of these pants but not the quality and now have a $100 pair of pants that I am not wearing due to pilling despite only wearing them a handful of times.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"EDMONTON, AB",ATHLETIC,"JANUARY 5, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
8,"I was so excited when purchasing my first pair of aligns as I heard it's a staple from Lululemon. Pro: The material is very soft and comfortable, which allows room for flexible exercises. Cons: I noticed slight piling when wearing my aligns to grocery shop. I did not think anything of it until a month later, the fabric in the inner thigh area is bumpy and has noticeably thinned out. I usually wear them for quick errands/yoga days. I throw them in the washer on delicates and hang dry them. So I'd like to say I have taken care of them accordingly. Overall, I'm very disappointed as I loved them at first. However, I wish the $100 quality of the material lasted as it quickly deteriorated. Perhaps it's more suitable for people who's legs don't rub together when walking.",2,YOGI,25-34,"TORONTO, CA",ATHLETIC,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
9,These leggings are disappointing. I have bought from Lululemon the last 15 years. The quality of these is awful. Pilling after a couple wears on inner legs and the material wears out so quickly.,2,,25-34,,ATHLETIC,"AUGUST 30, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
10,"I have worn these items twice and washed twice, there are two places where the seams are coming apart. They're so comfortable and I love them otherwise but super disappointed in the quality as they are not cheap and have always thought of lululemon as a quality manufacturer.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"TORONTO, ON",CURVY,"AUGUST 17, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
11,"I don't mind spending the money on Lululemon pants as they are normally high quality and stand up to all my workouts, but not this time. I always loved the feel of the align pant, it's like a second skin. However, my align pants started pilling in the crotch and all along my inner thighs. Now I'm embarrassed to wear them. I take care of my clothes too, and it looks like I'm not the only one who's had the same issue. I'm upset because I really do love these pants and for the money I spent on them I was hoping these would last a lot longer than they did. Now I have a $98 pair of pants sitting in my closet that I'll never wear again.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,ALBERTA,MUSCULAR,"AUGUST 10, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
12,"I have been wearing Luxtreme Lulu tights for years - they are my favourite tight to work out in and the first thing I put on when I get home from work. I recently went to purchase a new pair when I was with a friend and she suggested I try the Align pant. Thought it would be good to try something different. I loved them for the first few wears however, they started pilling a couple weeks after I got them! They now look like an old pair of leggings and my Luxtreme tights still look brand new.
I don't wash them differently than any of my other Lulu gear so not sure why this is happening. I really wanted to like these but the fabric does not preform well.",2,RUNNER,25-34,"TORONTO, ON",ATHLETIC,"JULY 23, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
13,Super comfy material. However I have started to notice lots of piling with these pants which is weird because I have just recently purchased other align pants and they have no piling and I have worn the other align pants more than these camo ones which were purchased a couple months ago.,2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,BRITISH COLUMBIA,ATHLETIC,"JULY 19, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
14,"The most recent pair that I bought was in ""True Navy."" I loved it until I washed it, and I noticed that the inside seams had start to pill and wear away. I put it in a mesh bag when I washed it in my washing machine. Then I wore it to the gym and during stretching, I noticed that part of the seams and the inside of the leg portion had pilled quite a bit. I really love my other Align's and have had them for a few years now, and only recently is my first pair pilling, however my newest pair already looks older than my first.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"EDMONTON, AB, CANADA",ATHLETIC,"JUNE 30, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""

16,"So I bought the align pant a while back but returned because of the pilling issue. Decided to give it a go again hoping they would address the issue by now. Bought two pairs - black and grey. Gosh they fit and feel like a dream at first but after the second wash, no matter what you do (followed the directions) they begin to pill and fade. And they're not as soft anymore. Such a shame to spend $200+ for leggings that are only good after one wash :(",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"VANCOUVER, BC",PETITE,"JUNE 19, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""

18,"These pants were amazing, but after almost a year they're just not any good. The lady in the store told me not to work out in them, which is fine for what I wanted them for. I was very diligent with washing them, but they still pilled. I can handle pilling of pants in the thighs as for me that is common. What I am really disappointed is that they started pilling on the outer thigh region as well. Don't let the buttery smoothness fool you.

19,"I have about 14 pairs of the Align pants/crops. I have been loyally purchasing from Lululemon since I was 14 years old, I know how to take care of my gear. I have some that have lasted years, I have some that have lasted months. Majority of these pants pill SO BADLY in the thighs in crotch area. However, I love the feel of these pants so the potential pilling was worth the risk as Lululemon had a great return policy with their gear that fell extremely short of your expectations. I have 2 pairs that I got for Christmas (5 months old) that are pilling so badly. I tried to return them and was told that they ""don't fall under their quality promise"".... somehow the horrible pilling many people are experiencing is not due to the quality of the gear?? I would not recommend you spend your money on the Aligns, although they used to be my absolute favorite. There are much better quality leggings you can get for $100.00.",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,,ATHLETIC,"MAY 28, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
20,"I just bought these leggings in the colour ""true navy."" They are completely see-through when you bend over. I don't understand how these leggings pass quality control, as this is not the first pair of Align leggings I have bought that have been see through.

21,I've had these pants for less than a week... I haven't used them to work out yet and I haven't washed them and they are pilling on the front of my thighs as crazy. This isn't a spot that has a lot of friction either so I have no idea why. They are super comfortable but I am very dissapointed in the quality. I understand they are delicate but I have only used them for lounging around the house. All my other lululemon leggings that I've had for years haven't had any issues but I am very disappointed in these.

22,These pants were amazing the first month of their lives and now they are horrifying. They have pilled in places I didn't think pilling was possible.

If money is no object and you are ok replacing them after a few wears great, but for something I would like to at least last the summer I wouldn't recommend:(",2,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA",SLIM,"MAY 21, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""
24,They pilled so bad and fast. Not even just between my legs but all over. They really look old and ratty fast. They are SO comfortable and don't move around during yoga classes.

They're really comfortable, but after wearing them only once, the crotch has pilled (I have an athletic build) so badly! The stitching on the waist band has also started to loosen and fray. I am pretty disappointed in these pants. I only washed them once (no dryer) inside out, and they already look so worn out.

30,"This year was the first year of me purchasing leggings from Lululemon. I have always purchased jackets and shorts, but I finally gave in and decided that aligns would be my first pair of lulu leggings. I purchased a black pair of aligns in size 4. They fit pretty well and like most reviews, they are super comfortable. I did hear about the pilling issue and I was determined to keep that from happening. Upon my third wear, I noticed pilling appeared on the side of the bottom right leg above my ankle. I was pretty disappointed when I saw the pilling and I didn't even use them for workouts. I have bought other lulu leggings since, and I now wear the aligns less often. I prefer the fast & free over the aligns. The aligns are very comfortable and the fabric feels fantastic. I would not recommend getting these if you have an issue with pilling as it will happen. The aligns are not worth $100.",2,RUNNER,25-34,"VANCOUVER, BC",PETITE,"APRIL 18, 2019","Align Pant II 25"""

That being said, I figured when my first pair started pilling within a few weeks (despite my best efforts to properly care for them), I figured maybe it was just because they were my favorite piece of clothing, wearing 2-3 x/week for regular endurance workouts. We had a summer pop-up store last summer, and I decided to buy a second pair to rotate them in hopes I could prolong the life of both pairs... needless to say, I was very disappointed with the second purchase, as a small rip in the FRONT of the crotch showed up after the second time I wore them (a lovely display of whatever choice of underwear color was visible to all!!).... I then patiently waited until my next trip to the city (as our pop-up store closed after the summer), and when I brought them back to the store, was given the option to have them hemmed- which I did in desperation to be able to wear them again.
Now, forward three months, I am left with two pairs of these pants (one 1st generation ALIGN and one 2nd generation ALIGN)... both have very bad pilling, as well as the first pair has a large rip along the seam of the pants from crotch, down the thigh, and the second pair (previously hemmed) have strands of the stitching constantly coming lose, and I fear another rip along the seam of those pants.
I would love to recommend these to friends, as I had previously said how much I WANT to love them, but am so bummed out that I basically cant wear them anywhere but in my home now.

I work from home and therefore wear these daily. They are great for everyday wear, errands, etc. The are very flattering and give a smooth, controlled look. I have a few trips booked this summer and they will definitely be coming along.
I do not wear them to workout. I have noticed many other reviewers reporting that they damage easily and show sweat. I can easily see that this would be true given the type of fabric. It just does not seem durable. I also do not think they would feel ideal for any type of high impact workout (I prefer compression style/feel, personally).

I have washed them twice. There is some pilling in between the thighs/crotch area.

Overall- buy these if you do not want them for working out.

Initially I was hesitant to buy these pants as other reviews complained of extreme pilling, but personally I have not experienced 'extreme' pilling. Due to the Align Pant II being a more ""delicate"" material, I treat them as delicates and care for them accordingly. With proper care I have experienced only mild pilling really, similar to how any clothing garment would develop over time with use. They are my go to favourite yoga/athletic tights great for both active and casual wear; I plan to purchase more.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"OTTAWA, ON, CANADA",ATHLETIC,"JANUARY 12, 2017","Align Pant II 25"""

If you are hesitating to buy these, I would definitely recommend you give them a try. However DO NOT put them in the washing machine, even if it is on delicate. Washing machines cause a lot of friction, thus rubbing the lulu fabric together causing it to pill very fast. Also, since the material is extra soft and stretchy, I would suggest downsizing!

I'm 5'8"" and some high waisted pants dont come up quite high enough and end up digging in just below my waist making it look like a muffin top. I don't experience that with these at all because the waist band is a nice length (great if you want a little extra tummy coverage) and the material is so soft and stretchy. I'm mostly into weight lifting and a little bit of cardio at the end of my workouts and they're fantastic for weights allowing for total movement without restriction and I've never experienced any sheerness with squats or any other movements. Be warned however, for cardio these do NOT offer any type of compression, so you're gonna jiggle and your thighs are probably going to rub together, which will most likely cause pilling between the legs. I'm personally fine with that and haven't yet experienced any issues with pilling and I've had mine for 6 months now. I'd absolutely recommend these for low impact exercise (yoga, weights) but if you're looking for leggings for running I'd go for a pair with a little more structure in the fabric.

I saw other concerns about the zipper, and while mine has not broken yet, it does stick and is not the easiest. That is why I am not giving this jacket 5 stars. I think it could also be a little longer, but I am 6 feet so I miss the days when Lululemon had more tall sizes available. This would be great in a tall option and I would buy every color, as I have already bought two in this one and I am moving back to a place where it rains a significant amount.

The cut was very flattering as well. I also found the material to be thicker and more durable than the Cloud Crush Jacket. Sadly, I realized that a size 12 would be too snug with anything other than a very light sweater and a 14 would be the best fit if I wanted to wear a warmer/thicker layer under it. I rarely find size 14 in stores and they were all sold out in any of the colours online. I'm happy that Lulu is getting more inclusive with their sizing, I just wish they would make more styles and carry more inventory of those styles.

I would buy them in many colours based on the above! But, sadly, the bad has now outweighed the good a mere 3 months after I first purchased them. About a month after they arrived, I noticed a fair amount of piling in the strangest place.... on top of the thigh area. I can't think of any reason for this, and the place where I would expect to see some piling on almost any pant (inner thigh) remains perfect. This bothered me, at the $98 price point, because they were only about a month old at that point, and I am always very careful to wash my Lulu items in cold water and hang to dry so they retain their shape and condition. Today, I looked down and saw the seam is unraveling on my lower right leg, and that, combined with the piling, is what has compelled me to sit down and write a review. At $98 a pair, worn once every two weeks or so for the last 3 months (and cared for properly), this is not acceptable quality by my standards.

If there is a pattern that you like in the longer lengths and you’re on the shorter side (I’m 5’2), then you’ll have to get them hemmed to be shorter and when they do that most of the time the ankles are tapered so they come off bigger around the ankle as a result.

I dont love technical or compression fabric, anything that is too tight and slippery- and since I work from home, and sometimes out of a yoga studio, and am active, and do a lot of laptop work on my bed :P, I need something comfy that I can wear around the house, to the gym, to the store, to work, without wasting time on changing my clothes all the time.
These are perfect and a no brainer, they feel better than being naked. The fabric is so soft and cozy, while being lightweight. The rise is so perfect... no muffin top, no weird lines, stays put no matter what. I dont know if they are squat proof but honestly I dont even care. I aint taking these babies off. I am starting a collection.
Since I am petite (5'4""), i found the full length to bunch up at the ankle a bit, but i actually like that for winter, it gives a cozy feel. For summer I may start buying slightly shorter lengths.
MY ONLY ISSUE: others have stated this alot, the V shaped panel of the inner thigh pills like crazy! I think it may be a part where the thigh rubs. However, since it is just a bit on the inner thigh I figure no one can really see it. I am not super happy about the pilling, but honestly Im not sure what I can do.

Why anyone wants high rise tights is beyond me. They go up to my rib cage and as soon as I bent over they rolled down. When working out I don't want an extra 6 inches of fabric around my middle to get even more hot and sweaty. Needless to say, I tried on several pairs of tights and left the store with nothing because I hate high rise tights. For ref. I am 5'5'' and 120lbs. Its looking like Speed Ups are the only tights I can purchase from you anymore and for whatever reason you only sell them in a handful of colours. Please come out with more colours and while you are at it, please make more low rise tights for us athletic women that want true comfort when working out. And another hint, instead of making fashion clothing, get back to what made you famous and put you on the map... athletic clothing.",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,"BANCROFT, ONTARIO",SLIM,"FEBRUARY 12, 2019","Align Pant 28"""

1178,"For the longest time I debated on purchasing these leggins since the price is insane but, I decided I needed to invest. I do yoga about 3 times a week and one of my biggest pet peeves is when yoga pants fall down and I have to adjust, which takes away from my workout.
These pants stay in place the whole time and the waistband doesn't dig into me when I bend over. I love that I can wear them many times without them stretching out and they form to my body just right. They are sweat absorbing as well and they dry, pretty much instantly after a workout. I also enjoy wearing these to work since so I can stay comfortable. I am a preschool teacher so I am constantly running around and bending over to pick up children. These leggings can be paired with a nice sweater to look more professional so I enjoy that I can use them for multiple purposes.
Another thing that I wanted to mention is the fit of these leggings. They feel like a second layer of skin and usually when leggins are thin like these, they are see through. Theses aren't and they smooth out the skin so your imperfections, such as cellulite don't show. I find myself picking these pants over all my other workout leggings every time.
One thing that I don't like about these leggings is how much they start to pill in the crotch area. I only wore them twice before this started to happen and I followed the washing directions which say to not wash with cotton clothes, turn them inside out and let them air dry, but they still continued to pill. With how much they cost you would think that this wouldn't happen. Also, I am 5’6 but have short legs and the leggins are a bit long on me and bunch on the bottom of the leg. If you have short legs like me, I would recommend getting the ⅞ leggings since I have a pair and they fit my legs perfectly.

A store rep explained to me its intended use and noted how to properly clean them. 5 measly months later.. I am left with a $100 pair of leggings covered in pills! I went to my nearby lulu for some assistance, asking for a replacement legging as I did love the feel of them compared to all other name brand leggings I previously purchased. However, I was scolded by the customer service saying that ""I must have misused them"" and did not offer any sort of support. One store rep told me the best she could do was send my pair in to get cleaned of the pilling. Great! I received my pair back 4 weeks later with maybe have the pilling on. Fast forward a month after my align leggings got ""refurbished"". We are back at square one.

27,"I will start by saying that I wanted to purchase some Lululemon leggings for running and was not sure where to start. You can read a million reviews that just leave you more confused than before you started. I am currently about 5'9"", 165 lbs and carry my extra weight in my midsection. I purchased one each of 4 different styles - Fast and Free, Pace Rival, Speed Up, and Speed Wunder Under. I bought a size 10 in all four styles. Currently, I run about 2-4 miles every other day. I have rotated through all four styles multiple times to give them a fair shot. I have followed washing instructions and all have held up so far. For all four styles, the waistband mostly stays in place. They all develop some amount of wrinkling behind the knee but that goes with the territory of running and the movement of that joint. After reading reviews about sweat showing through most styles, I intentionally only selected patterned colors.
Of the four styles purchased, these ""Fast & Free 7/8 Tight II *Nulux 25"" come in third place for me. The fabric does stretch out a little. They still stayed up and in place, but potentially with more use they might be too loose. If you are someone who falls more in between sizes, I would maybe go with the lower, but for me I would not have wanted to go a whole size down. The other 3 styles have a zippered back pocket. These for whatever reason do not have a zipper there. I will never be able to trust running with a key there. For that reason, these are not practical for outdoor runs for me which is depressing for the price point and purpose for which I bought them. The fabric definitely provides the naked sensation.

74,"I have many, many pairs of Lululemon leggings, and they're all so beautiful and flattering on the body. I bought this pair in Golden Lime and it was no exception. It hugged my legs and showed off my leg muscles beautifully, and the colour was so bright and fun for summer. I am very comfortable in them and I love the pocket on the side. The cuff of the leggings are seamless, which I thought was rather weird, but it's not a huge problem. For me, the biggest problem with this pair of leggings is that they pilled after the very FIRST wear. Again, I own many pairs of Lulus, and I know that some materials are very delicate and need some special attention, so I made sure that when I was wearing these ones, I tried not to sit too much and I made absolute sure that I wasn't rubbing the pants on anything. It was just a day at work and I tend to be on my feet most of the time. I also HANDWASH all my Lulus's inside out in cold water, and then lay them flat to dry on a polished marble surface. There was absolute no explanation as to why this pair pilled. I have been very careful with my other pairs and take such good care of them, that none of the other pairs have pilled on me, so when these Fast and Free Tights pilled so badly on the back, I was absolutely shocked. At this price point, no Lululemon clothes should ever be pilling, especially when I am taking such good care of them. I am thoroughly disappointed because I love this colour so much and have nothing else like them, but the pilling on the back is so bad that I am embarrassed to wear them again :(",1,YOGI,18-24,VANCOUVER,ATHLETIC,"AUGUST 1, 2019","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

I can’t return them, as the tags are off and they have been washed, but I guess I can keep them for around the house.

I am typically a 10 in Lulu, 5'8"" 175 ...but in the fast and free's i prefer an size 8, i think they run large, and stretch out, but with an 8 i don't have that issue. I use them for running, power-lifting, and cycle class and to be honest they are the most versatile pant i own from Lulu. Because there is no zippers, you could even wear these to a yoga class and be just fine! I hope they come out with more fun funky patterns, and more bright colors! I would love a hot pink! Note i even ran a 1/2 in a brand new pair. that i had never tried on. They work that well.
The only con is that they DO show sweat on the light solid colors... like.. be prepared to look like you peed your pants. The dark and patterns i have not had this problem.

204,"I have these pants in 2 colors: Black and Dark Olive. I am interested in getting the same pants in other colors such as the Dark Navy and Melanite and white or maroon if one day, Lululemon releases them in 7/8. I wish they made more pants with the same Nulux fabric. such as the aligns. This fabric is soft as silk and it's almost like you have no pants on but you know you do. If you are a runner or a person who sweats a lot, these pants are THE BEST you NEED to get these. The other Lululemon pants such as the WunderUnders or Aligns are more for weightlifting or just going to the gym since the fabric is not as breathable. However these Fast and Frees are very breathable and even if you sweat a lot, no one will be able to tell. I have been wearing the Fast and Frees twice a week (one day for olive and one day for black) to run an outdoor trail and also weightlift in the gym. These are my favorite leggings because I can't wait for them to get out of the wash. I wish I had more money to complete a week's worth of fast and free leggings. But sadly, I am a ""poor"" college student and have to stick with two for now and use my few years old Lululemon leggings or some other brand ones which are truly not the best. Truly sweat-wicking fabric and I wear them on the days I know I will sweat a lot. I have more muscular legs and out of all the fabrics and cuts, these leggings are the most flattering. For perspective, I am 5'3'', around 125 pounds and I typically wear a size 6 in Lululemon leggings/jackets. Lululemon makes THE BEST QUALITY athletic wear. Durable: Lasts for years! One of the leggings, I have been wearing once every week. Same for one of my define jackets as well. I will always be a loyal customer since Lululemon really puts thought into their products and they don't just care about selling they care about the function and making you LOVE their products! Love the little details in every Lululemon product. For example, the define jackets have thumbholes, hand covers, a hook hole, emergency hair tie... can go on and on.

For size comparison I do wear Ivivva in size 7 or 8, but the fabric is not as good and the waist is a tad bigger. The only challenge is the colors are the same for size 0s.

317,"My first Nulux. Good comfortable light material. Not as compressive as full-on luxtreme. It really feels as though you are wearing next to nothing. I purchased it in a bold print. Solid colors may show creases, lumps and bumps, etc, since material is not so compressive... depends on your body. The unfinished hems is a nice feature. It is less binding and looks okay bunched up when the inseam is too long. Please make them in more prints. Also, 23"" inseam would be a worthwhile addition.
By the way, can Lululemon make some tights with a slightly ""looser"" waist...there is where some of us store our fat. I think the high waist is suppose to hold in/camouflage the fat. On me, the high waist rolls. A slightly ""looser"" waist, high or low, would be preferred over a binding waist. It is the compression of the material in the appropriate place (ie. on the butt) that prevent the tights from sliding downward. A tighter waist, even if it is a high waist, would not do so. Runners, jumpers, endurance walkers know that the thin band around the waist that can be tightened will only prevent the ""sliding downward"" for a short time. Besides, working out with excess material bunched up around the waist is strange, especially when you sweat.",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,45-54,"NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, USA",PETITE,"OCTOBER 15, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

I cant say I regret the purchase quite yet though, I love them so far!!!",4,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"MINNESOTA, USA",MUSCULAR,"APRIL 16, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

493,"I really loved my old lululemon leggings so I decided to purchase another pair, they are very similar to this but not the exact one. After a few uses, I was disappointed to see a lot of pilling where the pockets are! I only ever kept my phone in the pocket and now im scared to put it back because I dont want to ruin the material, that should be able to handle a phone. The seams also have a bunch of pilling just after a few uses and it really gives my leggings a terrible look. I am disappointed because the quality seems to have decreased.",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,18-24,"TORONTO, ON, CANADA",ATHLETIC,"APRIL 13, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

494,"When I first bought these leggings I loved them so much that I bought 2 pairs, a black pair and a navy pair. They fit amazing well during the first month of wearing them. However, the top began to stretch out a lot and although there is a tie type of thing to make it tighter it is super uncomfortable. Additionally, on one pair, the pocket where I put my phone has become super pilly. I only washed these leggings in a mesh bag, by themselves, in cold water, and air dried them, and the fact that the quality of these leggings deteriorated in less than 3 months is extremely disheartening. I thought I found the leggings I would love forever, but I will not be purchasing these again.",3,YOGI,18-24,,,"APRIL 12, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

495,"I loved these when I originally purchased and was even willing to pay the extra cost because I loved the look and fit. Unfortunately, after hardly any wear I could tell that these were not good quality. I hadn't even washed them and the seams began to ball up. Additionally, the fabric is a bit more light weight which is one of the things that drew me to them but the light weight nature of the pant caused them to rip after a couple of uses which was extremely disappointing as I hadn't even worn them in a high intensity work out class. I bought them as more of a ""lifestyle"" pant. Needless to say I'm very disappointed in these over-priced pants.",1,RUNNER,18-24,LOS ANGELES,PETITE,"APRIL 11, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

496,"I bought the tights about a month ago, washed them maybe 5-6 times and they stretched out completely!! Plus the fabric started to be wrinkly. I’m very disappointed since I’m used to better lululemon quality. I’ve got the winter edition once and was super excited to run in them but since they stretched a whole size up I can’t really use them for running anymore!

497,"I bought this pair of leggings (my first lululemon pair!) after a recommendation from an employee while visiting the store for the first time. I was training for my first half-marathon and wanted to splurge and purchase an expensive pair of leggings. The seams didn't even last two washes before they started to fray. I brought them back to the store and an employee had them re-seamed, but the same thing happened after two washes (on delicate) the seams frayed completely. I am extremely disappointed with them and haven't worn them since.",2,RUNNER,25-34,"NEW YORK, NY",ATHLETIC,"APRIL 10, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

498,"I got a gift card for my birthday and bought these pants. 2 weeks later the seams in the calves were coming undone so I took them back and swapped them out. Got the new ones home and the seam in the back wasn't even lined up (looks awful on this tight of a pair of pants), so once more I drive back to the store to swap them out. I get the new pair home and they have holes in them from the way they were stitched. I never even took the tags off of them. Such a disappointment when you spend this much on pants. Back to the store I go. Maybe they will reimburse for gas? LOL",1,SWEATY GENERALIST,25-34,"BOISE, ID, USA",ATHLETIC,"APRIL 10, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

499,They pants are amazing! they are by far my favorite pants to crossfit in BUT.. the seams on the sides seem to fray easier than some of my other Lulu Pants. That hasn't stopped me from buying other colors though.. I air dry them and about every 5 wash I will lightly dry them in the dryer and it seams to help with the seems. They make your butt look ahhhmazing!,3,CYCLIST,25-34,"DENVER, CO, USA",LEAN,"APRIL 8, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

500,"I bought these pair online and they just came in on Monday April 2, 2018. I bought these because when I tried them on, they fit great and the smooth material and they had pockets. I have wore these pants twice for lounging and they have already began to loosen causing me to have to consistently pull them up. I had tightened the elastic that is around the waist but it did not help the bagginess in the crotch/bum area. I definitely do not recommend these to anyone! You would think with the price of $138 they would be better quality.",1,,18-24,KINGSTON ON,CURVY,"APRIL 7, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

501,"I bought this pair because of the smooth material and the functional pockets. However in a span of less than a month, they had already began to loosen causing me to have to consistently pull them up. I had tightened the elastic that is around the waist but it did not help the bagginess in the crotch area. To add to that, the entire seam at the pocket came undone. The seams all along the side of the legs began to fray. Keep in mind, I had only worn these for lounging a few times and kept extremely good care of these considering it was $138.

504,"When I tried on these leggings in store, I thought they looked amazing. I wanted to buy them for the convenience of carrying my phone when walking and running, and because they were really smooth and light. Less than a month later, my leggings started pilling (not around my inner thighs but around the upper back and all around the outside of my thighs where the pockets are, which hardly use). I wanted to return them then but I was too busy to visit the store. Now it's been half a year and they're getting worse everyday. If these leggings were under $100 they might have been worth it but the price and the quality do not live up to what it costs.",2,RUNNER,18-24,"VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA",ATHLETIC,"MARCH 31, 2018","Fast and Free Tight II 25""

However, they do not stay up when i am running, they constantly want to slide down and I hate having to stop and pull them up. It doesn't work for my needs, so keep that in mind if you are a runner.
