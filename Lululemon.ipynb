Then in late June I bought the same pant in the fleet? color - the light grey - and they were probably a half inch to an inch tighter in the waist, and shorter in the rise so they kept crawling up my rear. I'm 5 foot 3 and 115 pounds and the sixes have been quite comfy - but these grey sixes did not feel good at all, between the muffin top and the wedgie, so I returned them. Has there been yet another design re-vamp? Or did I just get a bad pair of pants? I held them up to my other two pairs and the measurements are definitely different, especially in the rise. I love to wear these when I teach ballet or pilates - wish this pair fit!\", '2'), (\"After wearing my former original Studio pants to pieces, was in the market for a replacement.

Initially, I had doubts - I didn't really like them on the hanger or online, but once I put them on, I FELL IN LOVE! I'm on week 3 and no pilling or loose stitching.

The best part of these pants was I could throw them on to be comfy and still cute, or over my leggings.

I get the long length should be long, but the regular at 31.5\"??? What I always loved about these pants was that they were fairly fitted on hip/thigh and then loose and baggy on the bottom with the puddling effect (due to the drawstring).

The SP III does exactly the opposite. It is so annoying and disappointing when companies discontinue good products (I'm sure the SP II was a good seller) In the case of Lulu they discontinue products that are flattering to not so small/skinny girls and replace them with tighter/more snug/slimmer products.

      "K for starters I should have you all know I have like 8-10 pairs of the studio pant II. Can you say problem? Yes! I get it but i LOVED these pants, I guess I still do. So my early pairs of SP were AWESOME!!! The length was fabulous the construction was awesome! So when I ordered a pair (i can only shop online) and they were surprisingly short, I chalked it up to just an off pair.. no biggy. Then I realized they had changed the length on the regulars, without notice! I continued to purchase because the new length was just enough to be annoying to me but not super noticeable to others. I went into a store when I was on vacation and tried on the black SP III because I will DIE if my II's start looking bad. I literally hang dry everyone of these pants!\n",
      "THEY ARE TERRIBLE! They are again shorter? The baggy part of the pant which made them look more youthful is GONE! I looked like my mother in a pair of just plain light weight pants. I actually asked the employees if they had any II's left in the black. They said they did, and handed me a pair. I know how they fit so I just took them and purchased them. I didn't try them on until I got home and realized they were the III's... GRR!!! I ended up giving them to my mother because they were more what she would wear.\n",
      "This literally SUCKS SO BAD!!! PLEASE BRING BACK THE II's in the ORIGINAL length!!!\n",
      "I have spent a fortune in LULU (i could host my own trunk show!) I just don't understand why they would change one of their TOP selling products? I love love love the original studio dance pant - the styling is relaxed and loose unlike all the other Lululemon offerings and whether lined or unlined is perfect for easy movement with no restrictions. The lined option was warm in winter while the unlined is perfect for summer. The studio dance pant III, however, is much more fitted with tapered legs, and runs a size, if not 2 sizes, smaller than the original. The tapered legs are not even a stylish taper - it's the middle of nowhere, neither completely snug, not straight leg, nor boot leg. And with the taper comes much more restrictive movement. Lululemon has copious tight and fitted pant options, why take the one loose option away? Very disappointed with my last purchase, and even more disappointed to see the studio pant III renewed in today's email of \"new arrivals\". Time to find a new brand. (I would have returned them except I bought them online and they arrived when I was heading out of town so I threw the package in my luggage and didn't bring another option thinking they would be similar to the II; however, they weren't, but being all I had, I had to wear them.) I am a doctor and the Studio I and II have been my go to work pants, travel pants, and errand pants for years. I own 30+ pairs of originals and IIs. They all have been worn hard, with every bodily fluid imaginable on them, and they withstand washing, wear and tear beautifully. I am 5\"4\" and 105-110# and normally a size 2, and a size 4 for extended 14 hours shifts or long plane rides where comfort reigns over how well my butt looks in them. I have purchased 3 pairs of studio III- the fuschia, the cocoa and and the navy , each time hoping I just got a bad pair- but no , these pants are just wrong. The crotch is tighter giving camel toe VERY easily - even in a SIZE 6, and are not just slim fit, but more tapered leg that doesn't fit over the top of a tennis shoes so it just bunches on top. The material isn't as breathable as the old studio pants. And one pair shredded in my HE washing machine the FIRST WASH. Please, please , please bring back my II's- literally my favorite pant ever. I understand younger girls may like this tapered look, but us 40+ crowd just want a comfortable, flattering fit.\n"

      "I love these pants and now have a total of 12 pairs between the version 2 and now the 3. Love all of them. I have seen these on all shapes and sizes of women and they look fantastic. The only time I noticed they didn't look good on a lady was when they were way too big on her. They accentuate the waist while hiding belly bulge and no one has a muffin top with these pants. Perfect pockets. Nice and lightweight. I always run hot and these allow air cooling with the lightweight material. I often have new pairs of them hemmed at my dry cleaner. I do not use the cince at the ankle, not a fan but don't mind that it's there. I go from 132-140 5\"5 and the 4 is very fitted, 6 is perfect, and 8 is too big in legs. I like to have a couple sizes on hand depending on how I want to wear them. When I spend this kind of money I am meticulous about washing. I use a cold sport laundry liquid soap, turn inside out, tie all waist strings so they do not snag other items, speed wash with only lulu like items, hang from waist to dry. I have a really old pair that my husband has washed with towels and fabric softener(big no no) and they look very weathered. My other pairs look almost brand new. I love to wear these with the now retired dance studio jacket. That jacket is amazing. The in flux jacket is a sad replacement and makes even the thinnest women wearing it look thick in the waist. At least we still have the studio pant. Previously, I have had many issues with the dance studio pant. Specifically, I am referring to the original version. I could never get the fit right. The size 2 was a smidge too tight, but the 4 was far too big (for reference, I usually wear a size 2 fast an free, but a size 4 in the tight stuff tight and under under crop). By the end of the day, I looked like I was wearing a cross between an MC hammer or balloon pant. I also found myself tripping over the excess fabric / wider part of the pant, below the knee. I finally gave up, and figured my life was fine without a pair of these in it. However, I received a pair of these (version 3) for Christmas, and I absolutely love the fit. The size 4 is perfect, and I love the flattering fit. They're not tight, but they're slightly fitted. I also love that the legs seemed more streamlined, because there isn't that excess fabric. I am short-waisted, and these are a true mid-rise on me. I'm 5'5\", and the length is perfect. I love the new, slimmer leg. I've tried on the previous version in the store but never thought the big legs looked good on me. I bought the navy and the grey, and I think the navy fits just a tiny bit smaller. I'm 5'3\"/125 lb/31\" inseam/27 in jeans and ordered the 6 in both colors. I think the grey runs a bit big and considered exchanging for a 4, but after trying on the navy, which is just a bit shorter and smaller, I'm glad I kept the 6 just in case they shrink (or if I gain a few pounds). I have to tie the legs on the grey but not in the navy. And a previous reviewer mentioned a short rise - I would agree, but I didn't knock a star because they still fit me well. I have worn them so much, especially the grey! I'm happy with how they wash up, too (put in the dryer for the first wash but I've air dried them since). I absolutely love the characteristic, subtle stripes in the fabric, and I'm so delighted the updated style works for me!\n"
